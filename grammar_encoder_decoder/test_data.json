If we keep using the current technology, the supply of uranium may only last 30 to 60 years depending on the needs for energy1. However, this kind of calculation is not accurate. It is because the heat efficiency in current nuclear plants is only 1%, which means 99% of the energy generated by nuclear plants is wasted4, but Scientists have already found out ways to increase the heat efficiency. In VHTR's prototype, the electricity generated is 50% more than the current nuclear plants5.

Tagging of these small sized devices may allow them to \"migrate under the skin\", which makes it hard to extract them.

Population ageing has also been intensified by increases in life expectancy at older ages because of education, improved healthcare, and technology. Such demographic changes might bring about severe consequences, most importantly national budgets might be under pressure as a growing number of elderly persons are supported by fewer younger persons. The debate is now whether the nation state should limit its public spending so that the saved resources can be utilized on other areas of the country's development. This essay will strongly argue that yes, the state should indeed limit its spending and focus more on economic growth so as to not to discriminate against the elderly , but rather to aid them in a more fruitful way which is beneficial for both generations. Economic growth has a \"trickle down\" effect and accompanies numerous positive externalities which helps the old in more efficient ways than continuous increases in healthcare spending which restrains GDP growth.": 1174, "There is no denying that nuclear energy is a dangerous source of energy and an example is the Chernobyl accident in 1986. It was caused by an error during a safety test and resulted in over 4,000 deaths and many more may die due to the radiation from the accident (Nature 2006). In recent years, there are also fears that nuclear reactors may be the targets of terrorist attacks. As a result, the public has been reluctant about the use of nuclear power as a source of energy. Nonetheless, there are still over 400 nuclear reactors around the world which make up for 17% of the world's electrical consummation (Butler, 2004). All of which have improved safety precautions and higher security levels to ensure the safety of the public.

Nowadays, genetic testing is becoming more and more prevalent to those who can afford and the diagnostic result can determine any possible genetic illness that an individual might suffer or carry. Genetic testing basically uses laboratorial techniques to examine the genes of an individual and identify any inheritable disease like Huntington's disease present. Thus, individuals with such genetic disease but do not suffer from it are called carriers as they can pass it on to their future generations. However, there are some ethical and social issues regarding to whether family of the carrier should inform his or her relatives. Although these issues are inevitable, the carrier should ultimately obligated to reveal the genetic test results to the family members as the benefits of it would outweigh any other problems.": 1176, "Undoubtedly, privacy advocates criticizes that such enforced obligation violates an individual's autonomy. They argue that for family interest to outweigh one's autonomy is unethical because there may be cases where relatives use one's genetic disorder information to their own advantages, rendering said individual to material loss and mishap social status. For example, a woman can easily claim custody of her children from her formal husband who has Huntington's disease, by asserting he will not have the ability to take care of their children in near future. While it is true that the extreme circumstances mentioned do exist in the society, one must agree that relatives have their reserved rights too, to know about the presence of genetic risk within the family because no one has exclusive rights over his or her genes as they are shared among the family. Spouses too have the rights to know when it comes to making a family just as he or she has equal rights over the children. Indeed, powerful protection has always been given to autonomy, privacy and confidentiality. However, these ethics can be breached when the action has an essential purpose, such as safeguarding others from harm, which unquestionably outweighs those said principles (Andrews, 1994). The absolute priority that they possess should be balanced by awareness of averting medical harm to fellow humans (Wang, 2001). Therefore, carrier of known genetic risk should be legally obligated to inform relatives, not just morally responsible to do that.": 1177, "In conclusion, a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives as communication of genetic test results can bring about improved management and well-being of carriers and their families, resolution of concerns, possible reduction in disease occurrence, as well as effective prevention, treatments and even cures.

Therefore, sharing of information between relatives should be encouraged.": 21, "Some opponents may think that the VHTR would be very costly. However, recent research supports exactly the opposite conclusion. The cost for VHTR including fuels and materials, reactor systems, balance of plant, safety, design & evaluation and fuel cycle is relatively low.

In addition, the microchips also applied to patients so that doctor can monitor their health condition such as heart beating rate, blood pressure and glucose level in blood. I must admit that, opponents of this position argue that microchip incorporated to a human's body can affects the system later on. It is because, our cells only can identify our own cells and it identify the microchip as the foreign cell and eventually immune systems will act against the microchip.

When an individual is made known to the external factors, he or she can make adjustments to his or her daily lifestyle. Consequently, the chance of an early death due to the genetic disease is reduced since one is not exposed to the decisive risk factor. For instance, one is tested positive for 1 antitrypsin deficiency- a genetic disease in which smoking is the decisive risk factor (Wilcke 1998).

Also, according to an article (Bonsor and Strickland, 2009), the number of surgeons and nurses required for robotic surgery will be much less than conventional surgery and the hospital stays are generally shorter due to quicker healing time.

As the waste recycling is not needed in the operational process, plutonium, which is a key ingredient of advanced nuclear weapon, will not be easily obtained from reprocessing waste. Thus, counter nuclear weapon proliferation. Furthermore, terrorist attacks on nuclear plant will not be of great destruction as compared to the 911 incident. The percentage of destruction on nuclear plant by a large aircraft being used to attack a nuclear facility with the purpose of releasing radioactive materials is close to zero. The US department of energy concluded that reactor structures are robust and would protect the fuel from impacts of large commercial aircraft. (Hardy & Haven, 1999).

To solve this problem, the VHTR is designed to be able to cool itself down in the event of an accident with minimal human intervention, which is called passive safety (Butler, 2004). In the past the reason why the nuclear accidents usually were very serious was that the fuel had the tendency to heat up automatically. So a small inducement can cause a huge disaster. As VHTR has this important feature, disastrous events can be effectively avoided and the prevention does not depend on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operators any more. Furthermore, VHTR has a goal to essentially eliminate the need for offsite emergency response. The strategy for meeting this goal is to identify severe accidents that lead to offsite radioactive releases (New clear agency, 2002).

Due to the large population of the elderly, the aging issue is raising more and more concerns in the current society. One of the concerns is that the governments need to spend a greater expense on the elderly to ensure their physical living standard as well as their psychological conditions. However, someone proposes that such actions can not fully solve the problems. The governments should invest on other areas so that the development of the country will ultimately resolve the aging problems. I strongly agree that with this argument that the improved country competency will benefit the elderly-concerned issues since the technology advancement can enhance the country productivity, the economic growth will ensure the continuation of the welfare program. First and foremost, the progress of technology increases the country income so that the country can take better care of the elderly. When we review the history, we can not ignore the extraordinary benefits brought by the technology. In the Industrial Revolution, the arrival of the famous sophisticated machinery \"mark[ed] the transition from a stable agricultural [society] to a modern industrial society\". The economy grew immediately and Britain became the most powerful empire during that period. In recent years, computers are involved in every aspect of the production activity, ranging from mass production to service serving. This involvement has freed people from demanding and repetitive jobs and at the same time increased the efficiency of production. The increase of the efficiency will bring more revenue to the country and therefore the government can spare more money on the elderly. Moreover, the positive economic growth can ensure the continuation of welfare programs. The welfare programs mainly aim to provide financial aid to individuals who are in need. In most countries, the unemployed, disabled and the elderly are the major targets. Government, together with some private organizations, is one major sponsor for the welfare program. Generally speaking, the government will spare a certain percentage of its annual income on the welfare. Take Italy as an example, according to Wikipedia(2009), the pension payments are reported to be supported by 18.5% of the total income tax. However, such a large proportional expense can only be achieved under the condition of stable economy environment. Facing the US economic downturn, President Obama has enabled a series of economic stimulus plans which include the \"American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\". The Act mainly targets at cutting federal tax, providing benefits for the unemployed and increasing the spending in education, health care, and infrastructure. The total investment on the Act is about $787 billion dollars(Wikipedia, 2009), which comprises a large proportion of the total income. Hence, the expense on welfare, especially the elderly, has been largely cut off. Hence, to ensure the health economic growth also make contributions to the welfare programs to the old. Although the government should invest its expenditure for country development, it does not mean that the government should cut the pension payment. Unlike the traditional Asian families which play a key role in taking care of the old, most western families have a looser connection among the family members. The elderly, in most cases, live separately with their descendants. Besides, some old single women have very low income to support their life. If the government cuts the pension aid, the social cost and repercussion on families and local communities may be higher. Hence, not only the family but also the government should take the responsibility to take care of the old. The government needs to spare a reasonable amount of money on pension payment and elderly facilities. To sum up, the government should control the expenditure on pension cost and put effort in the overall development at the same time.

Choosing not to inform one's relatives is in fact interfering with the patient's right and opportunity to consider the problem, select diagnostic and management options. Studies have shown that the primary reason accounting for the unwillingness to communicate genetic test results to a relative is that the relative's opinion, attitude and reaction is unknown (Barsevick, Montgomery, Ruth, Ross, Egleston, Bingler, Malick, Miller, Cescon, & Daly, 2008). In addition, the opinion of World Health Organization (2009) is that choosing not to inform is a well-intentioned decision which do not to add extra problems and unduly distress to others. However, these arguments put forth in support of not informing the relative are faulty. By not informing about the risks his or her relative may face, the tendency of the carrier to shift from beneficence to paternalism has in fact taken away the ability of the relative to choose for herself (Kultgen, 1995). For example, some genetic diseases such as \"Al antitrypsin deficiency\" undeniably involve the family (Torgny & Wilcke, 1998).

They might have been trained to operate but do not understand the principles behind it. The design could have incorporated automated controls to reduce the number of errors that could be made. Leptak(2009) suggests that to maintain a safe operation, there should be fewer autonomous control and more 'redundant automated safety interlocks'. This is to prohibit safety controls from being bypassed.

In addition, RFID can also be used for tracking of patients. Tracking of patients using RFID helps to solve the problem of medical staff searching for patients that were lost when moving about between medical facilities for treatment. This will raise the efficiency of treatment done in the hospital and also prevent patients from leaving the hospital without receiving full treatment.

Other new technologies can only operate up to 600-800 degree Celsius (Butler, 2004). This fact makes the VHTR more thermally efficient than other types of reactors. As it can withstand high temperature, melt-downs will not occur so frequently. Therefore, it would be beneficial to concentrate our research into this VHTR technology.": 98, "United Nations. 1948.

This is because when one is aware of it especially the parents, they can seek treatment even before the genetic disorder comes into effect, thus leading to little or no drastic change in one's lifestyle. An example would be neonatal screening for sickle cell disease, when an affected child is diagnosed with this disease at an early stage, it can reduce childhood mortality and morbidity (Nuffiel Council, 1997).

Taking the following factors into account such as the soon retiring baby boomers, the higher life expectancy of the Singapore population and the persistent reduction of birth rates over the past few decades, it is clear that a dramatic demographic change is on the cards. It is undeniable that our society is aging, and there will be exponentially increased needs for more healthcare, pensions, homes, and other social welfare considerations for the elderly. However, there should be a limit to the country's expenses on the aged. I feel that instead of focusing all their efforts on trying to tackle the problems directly, government should step back and take a look at the bigger picture. Addressing other issues that contributes to a country's development such as the economic growth, education and military is just as important. An important issue that affects a country's development would be economic growth. According to a sample of OECD (Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development) countries, which consists of 30 large economies, 1 percent a year increase in output growth over the next 50 years might only ease the increase level of pension expenditures to GDP by 0.75%. Thus, substantial increases in economic growth would be needed to offset the increase costs of aging (Visco, 2008). Economic growth could be achieved with greater productivity. Government and companies could hence import or invent better technologies to increase productivity. Singapore could also enable more young people to work as well as encourage longer work lives (by encouraging \"flexible retirement\" arrangements) to increase economic growth (Jackson, Howe, Strauss, Nakashima, 2008). A prosperous economy would allow major public pension reforms while reducing the burden on the people. Therefore, equal or more amounts of money and attention should be given to the country's economic growth. Education is one area of a country's development that should never be overlooked. Investment in education benefits the individual, society, and the world. Education in Singapore aims to shape citizens to be \"responsible to family and country\", and to \"have courage and conviction in facing adversity\"; it also aims to shape the potential leaders to be \"committed to improving society\" and \"be able to forge breakthroughs in a knowledge-based economy\" (Ministry of Education, 2009). Within the 12 pillars of competitiveness, education took up 2 pillars: health and primary education; higher education and training, in determining the country's economic competitiveness (Schwab, 2009). An educated and skilled workforce contributes largely to the knowledge-based economy. Studies links education to economic growth as it contributes to improving productivity which leads to higher income and improved economic growth (The World Bank, 2009). Education also reduces crime, and promotes equity, justice and intercultural understanding (The World Bank, 2009). It is very important that Singapore should maintain its education system to ensure political, social stability and economic prosperity of the country in the future, which is of great importance to the country's development and an aging society. Singapore should have also realised that youths are treasured assets in aging societies. Hence defence posture and military strategy should be deeply thought of to prevent lost of our men. Singapore should look at more substitutions of military technology for manpower and nonnative for native manpower. Military could also look at offering immigrants citizenship in return for service as well as hiring freelance mercenaries from foreign countries (Jackson, Howe, Strauss, Nakashima, 2008). With drops of birthrates, Singapore should take greater care of her young men and at the same time, being a small country, she must be able to protect herself. Hence military is one important issue that the country should also look at and invest in. I do understand that not all elderly would have families or are able to take care of themselves. Hence countries should have a margin drawn according to the number of people who really needed help from government and before setting the limit to public spending on the elderly ensuring that they are taken care of. Singapore could set an age limit and look into the cases of each elderly who might need the help from the government. Funds should only be given to the elderly if their medishield and medisave are used up, and judging on each case, providing the appropriate amount to the elderly. For example, public spending for an old lady suffering from a disease should be given more funds than an old man without any income or family. There are many composites that make up a socially and politically stable country. Instead of merely focusing on public spending for the aged, we should also look at a broader base of challenges an aging society will bring to us. Singapore should continue the balance in distributing the right amount of attention to not just the aged but also the youths. Singapore should give equal or more attention to economic growth to solve the aging society, in contrary to allowing an aging society triumph over creating an economic downturn. We should also pay attention to other factors such as the education and military strategies as well.

For example, pregnant women have the option of deciding on whether to go for prenatal examinations or not to see if their new-borns would suffer from any genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease and Down's Syndrome. This may prevent the future generation from inheriting the mutated genes or become carriers of the genetic disorders. Ethical issues have been raised despite this advantage. This is because no one has the rights to give his or her consent regarding the decision on whether to undergo for the prenatal examinations or not (Anonymous, 1999). Embryos, foetuses and new-borns do not hold the responsibility in making this decision and they are unable to make it by themselves. This leaves the decision into their parents' hands. However, medical advances have made in-vitro fertilisation possible nowadays. If an embryo has a mutated gene after undergoing in-vitro fertilisation, this embryo can be discarded before being implanted in the uterus (Anonymous, 1999).

According to a statistic by the \"World Nuclear Association (2009)\", about 15% of the world's electricity generation comes from nuclear power. Despite being the most prominent replacement for coal and fuel, nuclear reactors received strong opposition from the public masses. The public's main concerns of nuclear reactors are the high cost of nuclear plants and nuclear research, the hazard that it poses and whether the nuclear reactors are really efficient enough to replace coal and gases. Nevertheless, further research and development funding is needed for generation IV reactor concept, namely the \"Very-High Temperature\" reactor. As cited from Iequipmentnal Laboratory (2009), the Very-High-Temperature Reactor or \"VHTR\" is a helium-cooled reactor which is graphite-moderated, with a one time uranium fuel cycle. It uses high core outlet temperatures that enable hydrogen and electricity production. Firstly, detractors claimed that nuclear reactors and their corresponding researches cost lots of resources and money, so much that it is not economically worth taxpayer's money to build and research nuclear technologies. According to statistics from \"The Virtual Nuclear Tourist (2005)\", taking fuel, capital, operation, maintenance and waste related costs into considerations, coal cost 29.1 $/Mw-hr while nuclear power cost 30 $/Mw-hr. The difference in momentary value between conventional coal processing and nuclear power is not that big a difference. Furthermore, \"Very-High Temperature\" reactors do not need to spend any money on waste recycling as all the waste goes directly to the repository. This means that the cost of this technology is about the same, if not, lesser than conventional coal processing.": 1329, "Opponents argue that the VHTR would have a great explosion potential since the VHTR operates in an extremely high temperature of more than 1000 \u00b0C. However, there is subtle safety design in the VHTR to reduce the potential of explosion. One good design is the utilization of helium as the coolant. Helium is an inert gas. It will not chemically react with other materials (International Atomic Energy Agency, 1996). Unlike water and most other coolants, helium can maintain its non-radioactive property even when it exposes (Institute for Scientific and Technical Information, 2000). Another safety design is the temperature-resistant material. Some promising materials like zirconium carbide can allow the plants to perform at the temperature up to 1800\u00b0C (U.S. DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee, 2002).According to Butler (2004), a similar high-temperature engineering test reactor in Oarai, Japan, has already successfully operated at the temperature of 950\u00b0C. The success of this reactor suggests that more advanced temperature-resistant materials can be developed in the near future. Besides these, other safety designs like the passive heat removal system can also enhance the safety factor of the VHTR. It can not only cool the nuclear plants fast, but also protect plants from seismic and other external events (Eul, 2006).": 1330, "There is an argument statg that revealing of individuals' genetic test result will benefit individuals' relative or parents. This is because individuals' relative or parents can go for genconcernsanand negativewhether they had inherited any mutated gene(s) or not.

Although revealing of individuals' genetic test result will benefit individuals' relative or parents, not much preventive measures can be done to delay or lower the risk of individuals' relative or parents from developing cancer or diseases. Therefore, there is not a need to reveal individuals' genetic test result as individuals can ask their parents or relative to undergo genetic testing without revealing their result.

According to Butler (2004), it costs about US$1 billion dollars to build a nuclear reactor. Hence, it has to have relatively lower operating costs to stay competitive with fossil fuel reactors. In fact, VHTR can produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with conventional reactors (Butler, 2004). Hence, being a much more efficient reactor, it lowers the operating and capital costs. It is also stated that VHTR can generate electricity at prices that are comparable with coal and gas. Furthermore, VHTR does not emit greenhouse gases. Currently, global warming is one of the most serious issues in the world. By cutting down on greenhouse gases emissions, it will eventually have a long term benefit for the public. The risks of greenhouse effects should also be taken into consideration in the decision to use nuclear energy. The high start up costs cannot outweigh the detrimental effects on the Earth by greenhouse gases. Moreover, although in the short run, companies running VHTR may incur losses, in the long run, they will be able gain profits. Therefore, high initial investments should not deter companies from setting up VHTR, as there will be long term gains for the public.": 1332, "Research and development plays is relatively important to determine the direction of an ageing population.

This way, temperature at the core outlet temperatures can reach more than 1000\u00b0C (Corwin, 2003). So, this design is significantly more thermally efficient as its reactor core is able to withstand higher temperature (VHTR's 1000\u00b0C to SFR's 600\u00b0C).

In particular, the O-rings in the SRB could not seal the joint when it was very cold. As a consequence, the hot exhaust gas leaked through the joint and burned everything up. Hence, it seemed that the technological deficiency was essentially the cause of the accident, as argued by Robert E. (1997). Although technological deficiency was behind the failure of the Challenger, psychology could be implemented to stop the disaster from happening. Before the launch of the challenger, what concerned the chief managers most were the preceding 24 successful space shuttle launches. There was probably too much pressure from the public. If the managers handled the pressure well, rechecked and tested the challenger carefully and decided not to launch the challenger until every safety concern was eliminated, the challenger accident could have been prevented.

Moreover, these RFID scanners are very cheap in comparison to a RFID tag.

Another issue is the possibility of data corruption. As RFID tags are rewritable and if they are not security locked, there exists a potential for pranksters to change the data on the tags with false information (Syed & Mohammad, 2008). On the contrary, some people might think that using shielding techniques on RFID tags is already an effective protection mechanism against data theft and data corruption (Syed & Mohammad, 2008). Although it is true that aluminium shielding can prevent hackers to steal one's data to a certain extent, it also makes transmission more difficult and might not be completely effective in preventing it (Syed & Mohammad, 2008).

As Wilpert (2007) states, safety of engineering design depends on three things, namely, effective process, production control and failure avoidance. However, the Chernobyl reactor, reactor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalniy (RBMK), was designed with problems of all these three aspects. Firstly, in the RBMK reactor, the process of insertion of rods, which are to regulate the reaction speed, is inefficient and there is no fast rod for emergency. It takes 20 seconds for a full insertion and this is too slow to prevent the core from running away when the reaction is under the unstable mode (Frot, 2001). Moreover, the rods are designed with graphite tip which, when first inserted, will increases the reactivity. Secondly, the production control of RBMK is poor. The core of the reactor is unstable at low power. When the accident happened, the reactor was at a test of low power, working with only a quarter of full power. Thirdly, the RBMK reactor has almost nothing to prepare for out coming gases. Without either a system to filter exhaust neither gases nor a containment structure (Frot, 2001), the release of radioactivity could quickly spread in all directions and causes more serious results. As analyzed, by removing the errors above, the accident can be prevented.

This is because when one is aware of it especially the parents, they can seek treatment even before the genetic disorder comes into effect, thus leading to little or no drastic change in one's lifestyle. An example would be neonatal screening for sickle cell disease, when an affected child is diagnosed with this disease at an early stage, it can reduce childhood mortality and morbidity (Nuffiel Council, 1997). Although the knowledge that there is a chance that the relatives themselves or their future children can have the same genetic disorder can cost them higher insurance premiums or even deny them of insurance coverage, there are regulations which can help them from being discriminated.

Having said that, the use of psychology during the process is done on the basis of an ideal situation, where the human labour is of the highly skilled and high capabilities. However, psychology during the design process fails to consider the lack of appropriate skills and training of the labour employed during the time of operation.

The information may be misused for consumer profiling by the company collecting all these personal information (Cormode 2006). Advocates of RFID argue that the technology will prevent terrorist from entering the nation by reducing forgery of passport (US Department of Homeland Security). However, the United Sates Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported that the ability of RFID to counter forgery comes from its use of encrypted digital data storage and not from its radio transmission capability.

Based on Collins COBUILD Advanced learner's English Dictionary, psychology is the scientific study of human mind and the reasons for people's behaviors (2006).

It enables an output temperature up to 1000oC unlike the existing reactors can only produce a heat temperature about 300oC (Butler, 2004). VHTR is more than three times powerful to the existing reactors. That means it will generate much more power during the same period of time. Besides, the VHTR can produce not only heat but also hydrogen productions. This is a valuable process because hydrogen-production can be further processed to other types of fuel which is suitable for use in vehicles. If VHTR is widely used, the amount of hydrogen-production could be enough to become a major fuel that can be another solution to the vehicle power system.": 1428, "Since the relatives of a carrier of disorders, espeially his or her family, have a higher risk, they have a right to know about it (Cancer.net, 2009).

Moreover, tragic nuclear accidents in the past, such as the ones in Chernobyl, Ukraine and Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, leave people in doubt over the safety of building new nuclear reactors. However, VHTR combines the latest safety features into its design. VHTR uses helium gas as its main coolant. Helium is an inert gas and thus it does not react and become radioactive when exposed to radioactive compounds. The core of VHTR is made of graphite, which provides further stability due to its high heat capacity and stability at a very high temperature. Also, the development of Leak before Break method for gas cooled reactor will reduce the a by-productakage. The method will test leak level based experimental data on break geometry and its associated flow rate (Billot & Barbier, 2004, p. 8).

Since all the family members share similar genes and DNA, the discovery of any members with a genetic risk of certain disease means that the rest of the family members are likely to have the same risk too (US National Institute of Health, 1998). Being in the same family, it is one's responsibility to taking care of each other's well-being (Forrest K, 2003). Critics of this point claim that there is a need to protect family members from the troubling information and that some of the family members may not be able to cope emotionally if revealed that they may be at high risk of a genetic disease (Agatha M et al., 2009). However, these concerns can be addressed by counseling as well as moral support from family members and the medical benefits that the family members can get from the information justifies the need to reveal the information to them (Forrest K, 2003). Hence, to fulfill the responsibility as a member of the family, carrier of genetic risk should tell his relatives his genetic test result.": 1431, "Secondly, individuals have the desire to protect family members from troubling information. This is because not everyone in the family will get the disease and disclosing such information to family members might cause unnecessary anxiety in the family. For example, a parent might not want to tell their children that she has a certain inherited disease as she is guilty about passing the mutated genes to her children. However, critics argue that family members should have the right to know if they are at risk of getting the disease. Since they are in the same family tree, the relatives should have the right to know the probability of contracting this inherited disease. This helps them to make informed choices about their health and maybe seek treatment before the disease bloom. Nonetheless, disclosure to family members may not respect their right of not to know. The carrier's family members might not want to know about the genetic risk and hence, disclosing such information might cause them to be anxious and panicky. These are unnecessary since the probability of getting the inherited disease given that a family member has the disease is relatively low. This is because one might not get the mutated genes. Hence, genetic testing results should not be known to the family members to protect them.": 1432, "Current nuclear generation(II and III) has been applied into different areas to generate secure and inexpensive electric energy.

The problem is not simply based on design faults, the root of these design faults are usually psychological factors such as carelessness, lousy moods, tired, fatigue and unable to stay focus. Psychological factors such as accountability, responsibility and professionalism play an important role in every design process.

If the results of individual genetic testing are revealed to employers and insurance companies, employers may not hire people who are diagnosed by with certain disease. Likewise, insurance companies may also refuse to serve people who have high risk of some disease (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999). Opponents may argue that law can be used as a mean to protect against genetic discrimination. They cited that a number of laws have been enacted to prohibit insurance companies from collecting information of genetic testing and using them to discriminate against people (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999). However, this approach is not effective. Firstly, most laws only restrict types of genetic information, but they do not ensure that people will be fairly charged if they reveal genetic testing results (Norrgard 2008). Secondly, laws still have limitation of prohibiting employers from refusing people who have genetic disorder (Maxwell & Mehlman 1999). Hence, using legal power to limit discrimination is incomplete.": 1446, "In conclusion, nuclear power is definitely one of the better choices when we are looking for a green source of energy. Nuclear power is one technology that must be accelerated promoted and relied upon if the world is to stabilize carbon emission at an acceptable level. Nuclear power plants are not nuclear bombs waiting to go off.": 227, "One of the most critical factors while considering the various power sources is cost. The general public will only approve of a power source if it is cost-effective. An obvious advantage of nuclear power is the massive amounts of energy it can generate. For instance, a single nuclear plant can generate four times as much energy as a coal-powered plant in its lifetime (Max, 2009). Sodium-Cooled fast reactors are also able to recycle spent fuel rods. Moreover, analysts have estimated Uranium to last us for at least another century (Leipoldt, 2007). Uranium is not so expensive to mine as its ores are found near the surface of the earth. All these suggest that nuclear power is actually very energy-efficient and cost effective.": 228, "The supercritical-water-cooled reactors run at temperatures which are higher than the normal nuclear reactors which means that more efficient conversion of heat to electricity(Butler,2004). However, the performance of the nuclear reactor is dependent on the temperature of the reactor core. This means that if the temperature of the day is higher than usual, the performance of the nuclear reactor will drop. This is because the temperature of the reactor core is affected by external factors such as weather. The performance also depends on how much electricity is output compared to the energy being needed to run the whole system. For the supercritical-water-cooled reactors, very high pressure is needed to prevent the water coolant from boiling at temperatures up to five hundred degree Celsius(Butler,2004).": 1447, "There.Blogging (2007, July 27), Electric Car vs. Hydrogen Car, Retrieved 15th October 2009, from http://www.thereblogging.com/ThereBlogging/FAB22DCF-AE95-4806- 934D-706E177C9D93.html": 229, "Secondly, a known genetic risk carrier is oa knownted to tell his or her relatives is due to there is possibility to save their lives.

The genetic testing is just a mean to know whether someone has the disease but it does not mean they will acquire the disease hundred percent (Goh, L., M., D., 2005). This only serves as a predictive mean. On the other hand, the other family members can also know what are the other underlying problems that they may encounter in the future as the genetic testing will not only detect the carrier's risk genes but also other problems that he or she may have in the future. With these ease in information acquired it will help the family members to prepare and face the potential problems in the future.": 1451, "At the beginning of 2002, 438 nuclear power plants were in operation in 31 countries around the world, generating electricity for one billion people.

However, the relatives might have significant effects if they are not informed of the result. This is because they might make themselves vulnerable to the decisive risk determinants of any particular genetic disease (Wilcke 1998). If they are informed of the result, they might avoid the risk of developing the disease. Thus, the consequences of being informed of the result are more preferable than staying in ignorance.": 1453, "However, there are arguments that are against the use of RFID technology in monitoring and tracking people and animals despite the benefits gained. One of the arguments that have been brought up is the difficulty in reading the information provided by the RFID tags incorporated in liquids and metal products (Pandey, 2009). These substances may reflect the radio waves which make the information hard to read. The RFID tags also have to be placed in proper positions, taking into account its angles and alignment in order to obtain a proper reading. This can be quite a hassle and it requires a lot of concentration. However, RFID tags are usually placed in an area with optimum frequency which enables the RFID readers to obtain the information contained in the tags correctly.

Even though it developed very fast in the past decades, it is facing a big problem now that nuclear output is worldwide shrinking. This is partially because of horror left by the disasters of 1979 at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, and of 1986 at Chernobyl, Ukraine (Butler, 2004). Now people are more concerned about the safety instead of the benefits of nuclear power. Therefore they keep on object against nuclear technology. In order to change the negative situation of nuclear power, in 2001, the Generation IV International Forum( GIF) leaded a new starting of developing next generation nuclear energy systems which are \" safe, abundant, reliable, inexpensive and proliferation resistant\" (Butler, 2004). There are six designs are believed to be the best prospects (see Table 1). Based on the goals for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems, Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is expected to be a better choice than other five reactors. This essay will evaluate this new reactor focus on three aspects: safety, sustainability and economics.": 1456, "In summary, passive safety concept rely more on forces of nature, and this approach increases the reliability and predictability of how the plants behave under various circumstances. Even though the doubts and concerns following also deserve much attention from the scientists and engineers, application of passive safety systems is definitely reliable and economical. To apply them not only can improve the safety issue, but also opens up bright prospects for nuclear power.": 231, "To conclude, the use of psychology during the design process is important. The key factors to prevent the train accident from happening are safety precaution, the proper actions taken during the accident and the use of high technology.": 232, "Lastly, SCWR gives a low cost of production of energy. The opposition of nuclear reactors criticize that nuclear energy is expensive due to the huge cost required in research and development. They also argued that are alternative methods like solar and wind power can be implemented. However, nuclear energy is in fact one of the least expensive energy sources. According to Moore (2006), in 2004, the average cost of generating energy from nuclear reactor was comparable with conventional methods in the US. Furthermore, advanced research will bring the cost down in the future. According to Butler (2004), S.C.W.R is cheap due to its simplistic design compare to generation III reactors. Also, wind and solar power are intermittent and unpredictable. They are unable to replace big base-load nuclear plants such as coal like generation IV nuclear reactors do. Therefore, nuclear energy is the only viable substitutes.": 233, "Furthermore, helium is used as the coolant in the VHTR system. Not only is it advantageous to sodium because it can be subjected to high temperature, it is also efficient in transfer of thermal energy. Helium will not become radioactive and will not react with other materials. Therefore in my opinion, VHTR is rated better only in terms of physical protection and performance as compared to SFR.": 1457, "Opponents argue that the VHTR would have a great explosion potential since the VHTR operates in an extremely high temperature of more than 1000 \u00b0C. However, there is subtle safety design in the VHTR to reduce the potential of explosion. One good design is the utilization of helium as the coolant. Helium is aninert gas. It will not chemically react with other materials (International Atomic Energy Agency, 1996). Unlike water and most other coolants, helium can maintain its non-radioactive property even when it exposes (Institute for Scientific and Technical Information, 2000). Another safety design is the temperature-resistant material. Some promising materials like zirconium carbide can allow the plants perform at the temperature up to 1800\u00b0C (U.S. DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee, 2002).According to Butler (2004), a similar high-temperature engineering test reactor in Oarai, Japan, has already successfully operated at the temperature of 950\u00b0C. The success of this reactor suggests that more advanced temperature-resistant material can be developed in the near future. Besides these, other safety designs like the passive heat removal system can also enhance the safety factor of the VHTR. It can not only cool the nuclear plants fast, but also protect plants from seismic and other external events (Eul, 2006).": 1458, "Genetic research and testing have advanced tremendously in recent years with tools such as the Genome Project (US National Institute of Health, 1998). As such, genetic testing is becoming more readily accessible for people to have their genes tested for any indication of greater risk of developing any diseases (US National Institute of Health, 1998). If an individual discover after a genetic test that he has a high risk of developing certain disease, it would mean that his familytaker who share similar genes may be at risk as well (Forrest K, 2003). Not only it is his responsibility to share his genetic testing results with his family (Forrest K, 2003), informing his family members will give them a chance for early detection of the disease as well as to make necessary family planning (Agatha M, Denise B and Kathleen A, 2009). Hence, carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his family members his genetic testing result.the carrier": 1459, "Another reason for opposition is the high cost of the very high temperature reactor. Given that the cost of the nuclear power plant including the very high temperature reactor is very high and it will take several decades to recover the cost, opponents think it is not reasonable to use the very high temperature reactor. However, according to the research done by the experts, the very high temperature reactor will be designed such that the generation cost will be competitive when compared with other energy sources and the capital investment cost will be low enough for a large number of countries. Hence, the very high temperature will prove to be competitive in pricing.": 1460, "Gerstner, Ed (2009). Nuclear energy: the hybrid returns.

Supporters to the use of psychology might argue that this is a high percentage; hence the use of psychology in the design process would have prevented the accident. However, this is not true. Non-psychology factors add up to 60% which is more than psychology factors. Moreover, the use of psychology during the design process will not reduce these 40% to 0%.

Accident is a situation when there is a failure in the interaction between man and machine (Stoop, 1995). Therefore, even though nuclear power is certainly dangerous, it can still be safe to work with as long as the interaction between man and machine is designed carefully so that it will not fail. Again, this shows the importance of considering psychological factors in design process. Most of the times, while designing a system, engineers are likely to overestimate the ability of the user (Wilpert, 2007). As a result, most users are not able to properly use the equipments. In the case of Chernobyl, the plant operators failed to make the right decision which then caused the reactor to explode. Instead of following the safety procedure, the plant operators even blocked the reactor's protection system (making it impossible for automatic shut down) in order to keep the test running (Onisawa and Nishiwaki, 1988). If the plant operators were familiar with the system and the procedure, they would have known which one was more important and would definitely have prioritized safety rather than keeping the test running.

Very-High-Temperature Reactor, also known as VHTR in abbreviation, is one of the six Generation IV reactors selected by GIF. There are claims against building VHTR due to safety issues relating to materials.

The decision of informing family members the results should be a personal choice. Because the results of genetic testing not only affect the person who takes the test but also relate to his family members, sometimes people may encounter dilemmas. Individuals may make different decision depending on their situations. For example, after undergoing genetic testing, people may find out that their siblings also have the same genetic disorder with themselves. However, informing them may result in huge changes in their life decisions. Thus, whether to tell them the results or not is a cautious decision that should be made by individuals (Norrgard 2008). Some may suggest that it is an ethical responsibility for people who are found to have genetic disorder to inform the results to their family members. However, since currently there is no legislation forcing people to do so, the results should be treated as privacy and should be protected (Norrgard 2008).": 1465, "In comparison, GFR require less visual inspection than VHTR since it produced relatively lesser heat.

Companies have to purchase tags (US $0.20 - $50 each), readers (UHF reader: US $500 - $3,000), middleware (may be US $183,000), upgrade system networks and pay installation fees (RFID Journal, 2005).

The obligation to make known the results of genetic testing will thus be a disincentive for people to even undergo genetic testing to help themselves. As we cannot control our genes, it is unfair to discriminate against a person's genetic predispositions. A federal measure, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), was signed into law in the United States, to provide protections against genetic discrimination (Norrgard 2008).

In the case of incurable diseases, knowing one's condition could influence many family planning decisions and other life choices. One can decide whether to have children of his own and risk passing the gene on to his children or consider using technology to assist selective reproduction. Also, decisions like the retirement age and the amount of savings for the future can be made when they are better informed.

Opponent views are that the very high pressure SCWR required may impose risks, which is indeed a realistic concern. However, this potential peril can be avoided by testing and choosing suitable materials which can withstand huge pressure and corrosion. Consequently, they help prevent formation of cracks or explosion. Furthermore, the proposed design of SCWR is much less sophisticated than the present reactors. It is greatly simplified after discarding away the step of steam-water conversion. It reduces the probability of making mistakes and level of seriousness of accidents. In fact, the safety measures are executed to the maximum for every design. It is hardly, as what many nuclear research associations have asserted, to have a second Chernobyl incident. Another advantage of SCWR is that waste generation is optional. This feature limited the extent of its nuclear pollution which leads to health problems like birth defective.

VHTR uses helium, an inert and fireproof gas, as the coolant instead of water used by the conventional reactors. Thus, it will not result in steam explosion, which can happen in reactors using water as a coolant. In addition, VHTR is designed to work under high temperatures. It has a reliable safety backup system whereby in case of machinery failures, the reactor will submissively fall to a safe energy level, without damaging the reactor vessels or the fuel spheres, allowing corrections to be made safely (MIT, 2003). Hence, this shows that safety precautions have been set to prevent accidents. On the other hand, instead of being a threat, the high temperatures can be used to produce hydrogen, which can eventually be converted into electricity for the public, making VHTR more efficient compared to coal reactors and even some of the other Generation IV reactor concepts.

This is a unique advantage of MSRs compared to traditional solid-fuel reactors (Charles W. Forsberg, 2007). [2] There is no high pressure steam in the core and the molten salt is of low pressure. We won't worry about fire hazard or explosion hazard. Thus the molten salt reactors are considered inherently safe because they are chemically stable. They do not react rapidly with moisture or air because the fuel salt does not burn in air or water. However, in traditional nuclear reactors or solid-fuel reactors, there is always boiling water or molten metal as coolant involved, which dramatically reduces their safety level. Besides, since the nuclear fuel is often dissolved in the molten salt, in case an accident happened, most of radioactive materials would not be dispersed into the atmosphere and spread to the environment nearby. And there is also a passively cooled storage which can secure the reactor by dumping the fuel to the cooled tanks if there is a leak.": 262, "In conclusion, robotic surgery is a safe and effective prototype with a worthy cost.

However, in VHTR, an additional processing step is taken to shorten the live span of the wastes and these wastes are carefully contained. In addition, VHTR produces less nuclear wastes.

This is because the basic technology envisioned in the VHTR is already in use by several current high temperature gas reactor plants based in countries like Japan, China and the USA (U.S. DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee and the Generation IV international Forum, 2002, p. 49). This means that the technology is already quite well estabsupplying energy ford thus less time is needed to research on the basic technology that will be used in VHTR as compared to the other power plants that may involve the use of totally new solutionsgies. In times like this where the price of fossil fuel and coal is sky rocketing, an earlier delivery date of 5 years for an efficient energy alternative is very crucial. If the VHTR can be realized as soon as possible, public concerns about the hefty pricing on carbon tax and fossil fuel can then be addressed earlier.": 1516, "Opponent of this position argues that RFID-installed passport is in fact, less secure than normal passport as anyone may be able to attstaffmeone else's personal information with an RFID-reader. They further argued that information in passport can easily be copied and embeenablesnto a forged passport (Campbell, 2004). However, those arguments are not entirely valid as the US State department has highlighted that many precautionary measures have been implemented to prevent such security breaches from happening (Broache, 2006). The passport will be installed with a metallic layer which prevents others from obtaining information of the passport holder from a distance. In addition, the information of the passport will be encrypted into codes and will only readable by authorities that are able to access the database (Broache, 2006).

An early detection of genetic disorders can be obtained by genetic testing in order for further and early treatments to be conducted. For example, genetic testing enables patients and their relatives who are at risk of developing genetic disorders but show no symptoms at the beginning, to predict the chances of them inheriting the genetic disorders (Goh, 2005). The predisposition of the relatives of affected patients towards the genetic disorders can also be predicted. When a genetic disorder that runs through a certain family is known, the extent of the genetic disorder can be obtained (Goh, 2005). Genetic information is not confined to one person but it could be related to more than one person such as tested patients' relatives. This enables healthcare professionals to know the extent of the genetic mutation in the genes and hence, provide advice or genetic counselling to patients and their relatives. However, this has also resulted in a raise of privacy and confidentiality concerns. The revelation of genetically tested patients' results may lead to discrimination by society (Mehlman, 1999). There is no guarantee that relatives of genetically tested patients will keep the genetic results information to themselves. This information can be spread verbally, be it accidental or intentional without the consent of the tested patient. However, there are laws that protect genetically patients from genetic discrimination by society that have been imposed (Bombard, 2007). These laws have been implemented in the United States and many other countries (Bombard, 2007). Genetic discrimination can be reduced with the existing of these laws as legal actions can be taken against those who discriminate. Hence, genetic testing results should be revealed to family members for early detection purposes.": 1519, "The use of surveillance technology to track people had become possible due to the advancement in technology.

Ever since the Chernobyl accident, many fear that history will repeat itself. They are worried that the safety of their children will be at stake. According to history, there have been only two major reactor accidents due to civil nuclear power, namely the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. As referred from the World Nuclear Association (2008), these two accidents are the only two in the 12,700 reactor-years of commercial operation of in 32 countries. Moreover, ever since the Chernobyl accident which happened in 1986, the standards for safety in nuclear reactors have greatly increased. Unlike the past, nuclear reactors now come with equipments that prevent operational disturbances which will in turn develop into problems. In addition, sub systems are also implemented to detect problems and prevent significant radioactive releases. All these new implementations come in all generation IV reactors, including the \"Very-High Temperature Reactors\". Thirdly, critics questioned if nuclear reactors are really efficient enough to replace coal and gases and claimed that nuclear power will never be able to replace coals and fuel in the near future. As stated, nuclear reactors are already generating about 15% of the world's electricity needs. According to the World Nuclear Organization (2008), a single average nuclear power reactor generates about 12.4 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electrical energy.

Georgetown University Hospital (n.d) provides an example of a successful patient, Evan, who fought against cancer via chemotherapy, with the moral support and empathy from his family members. In fact, carriers of certain genetic diseases do not necessarily exhibit the characteristics controlled by defective genes. For example, if the genetic disease is related to X-linked genes, only males are affected while females remain as carriers of the disease, unless it concerns the autosomal recessive genes (wrongdiagnosis.com, n.d.). Being a carrier of a genetic disease is quite common as Guggino and Stanton (2006) note that one in 20 Caucasians carries the gene for cystic fibrosis. Hence, there might be carriers of the same genetic disorder within the same family who can share experiences to help the carrier to understand his or her condition better if the carrier is obligated to reveal the testing result.": 1553, "Some may argue that it is the individual's right as to whether to reveal the result to others as the genetic test result belongs to him or her.

Furthermore, it may be too late to be treated should the disease be discovered at a later stage. Thus, the possibility of preventing harm to others should never be jeopardised over one's privacy. A research conducted by the United Staon' National Institute of Health, has shown that 98% of the respondents share their test results with their family members and 82.2% of them did that to inform them of their medical risk (Stoffel, Ford, Mercado, Punglia, Kohlmann, Conrad, Blanco, Shannon, Powell, Gruber, Terdiman, Chung, Syngal, 2008).

The results of genetic testing may open doors for potential discrimination in terms of job opportunities and insurances. An employer might not want to keep an employee who is likely to be diagnosed with some disorder. Similarly, a person who is known to have a high risk for a genetic condition may have difficulty obtaining insurance because he or she is likely to run up medical bills that would be costly to the insurance company. The obligation to make known the results of genetic testing will thus be a disincentive for people to even undergo genetic testing to help themselves. As we cannot control our genes, it is unfair to discriminate against a person's genetic predispositions. A federal measure, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), was signed into law in the United States, to provide protections against genetic discrimination (Norrgard 2008). Insurance companies were prevented from charging higher rates to customers based on genetic information and from collecting genetic data or requiring applicants to undergo genetic testing. With the legislation being law, the carriers should feel safer to share the test results.": 1555, "Firstly, genetic information could be extremely personal to an individual (Canadian Cystic Fibrosis foundation, 2000). Confidentiality of such information should be protected so that one's privacy could be respected. However, genetic information comes in two kinds. The first one is the mutation in a family while the latter is one's own genetic status. (Skene, n.d.). It is alright for not sharing own's genetic status but sharing of mutation in family with blood relatives is essential as it affects the blood relatives as well. He or she has the rights to know about it. Moreover, best clinical practice required family history to assess the usefulness of genetic testing (Parker and Lucassen, n.d.). Hence, there is no reason why one could benefit from the family history but omitted the relatives' rights to have such benefits as well. Genetic discrimination by health insurers and employers could be one of the main hinders that stop people from sharing their genetic information with blood relatives (National Human Genome Institute, 2008). This could be protected once President Bush had signed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (The white House, 2008).": 1556, "2. Wen, HJ. (2002).

For instance, some employers would install surveillance monitors in their workplaces to track the activities of their employee (Ball, K. & et al. 2006). This would subject the employees to constant fear of committing mistakes if they are aware that they had been monitored, it could diminish their moral which in return affect their productivity and efficiency at work. Furthermore, parents would resort in using webcams and GPS systems to check on their children' activities (Ball, K. & et al. 2006) instead of trying to communicate with their children to understand the friends they mixed with and to find out their whereabouts. This monitoring action causes a loss of mutual trust between the parent and child which is a foundation to build a strong family bond. Hence, the use of surveillance technology to track people should be banned as it creates suspicion between individuals causing the loss of trust. (Ball, K. & et al. 2006).": 1558, "It is without a doubt beneficial to inform relatives that they might be at risk of developing a hereditary disease when individual's genetic tests turn out to be positive (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, 2004). Relatives may choose to go for a genetic test to determine their status by checking for the particular mutation known to increase the risk of developing a particular disease (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, 2004). Should they test positive for the particular mutation, preventive measures and cost-effective treatments could be carried out to reduce the risk of developing the disease (The Changes in Health Care Financing and Organization (HCFO), 2005) but not every person with the mutation would develop the disease eventually. On the flipside, some people cannot come to terms with the fact that they might have a higher chance of developing a disease compared to other people. They might have very negative thoughts like anger, fear that they would develop the disease in the near future or if they have children, they might feel guilty about passing the mutation to their children (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, 2004).

Consequently, they help prevent formation of cracks or explosion. Furthermore, the proposed design of SCWR is much less sophisticated than the present reactors.

In fact, the safety measures are executed to the maximum for every design. It is hardly, as what many nuclear research associations have asserted, to have a second Chernobyl incident. Another advantage of SCWR is that waste generation is optional. This feature limited the extent of its nuclear pollution which leads to health problems like birth defective.

Helium is an inert gas and thus it does not react chemically with any materitemperature and thatat it will not cause any corrosion or react with any of the power plant's structure to cause damage. Thus the use of helium will not compromise the overall integrity of the power plant. In addition, unlike other coolants considered for other Gen IV power plants, helium also does not become radioactive when it comes into contact with radioactive materials. Therefore, even if there is a leak in the coolant gas pipes, it will not pose any harm or danger to the public. With these advantages, it is definitely an asset that helium is being used for the VHTR as the coolant because it is confirmed that it will not pose safety threats and cause any possible safety breaches in the long run.": 1566, "http://www.westinghousenuclear.com/Community/WhatIsNuclearEnergy.shtmcan be": 1567, "Operational safety is a prime concern for people working in nuclear plants. Workers working in a nuclear plant are prone to radiation doses. However, workers need not worry about it as radiation doses are controlled by the use of remote handling equipment, physical shielding and limiting the time workers spend in nuclear plant. (Levenson, M. & Rahn, F. 1981) Others may argue that accidents are inevitable. However, based on statistics, the number of fatalities in nuclear plants caused by operational accident is the lowest compared to other energy plants.

Together with GPS, it is also able to track their location and detect if they are in danger. This can also be used for other patients that requires special attention like heart and lung disease especially when it involves children and older generation. This is useful as the caretaker may not be able to attend these patients 24 hours a day. Thus, RFID help to ease their work but increase the efficiency simultaneously.": 1570, "The second perspective to illustrate why psychology is an essential factor to avoid the occurrence of the accident is that engineers who produce numerous tiny component parts could minimize 'erroneous actions' by applying psychology in their design (Wilpert.B, 2006). For instance, because of the limited time, the engineers working for Challenger space shuttle failed to comply with the criteria of producing individual high qualitative parts of the space shuttle (R. P. Feynman, 1996). In order to finish their tasks promptly, engineers threw away their occupational ethic. The basis of psychology is completing one's own task in high quality, yet this basic requirement is sometimes ignored by people, and consequently, extremely painful accident is triggered. The contrary viewpoints tend to attribute the O-ring problem to a simply technical failure that the 'factual account' of the accident is \"frozen, brittle O ring\" which causes the leakage of fuel and induces the exploration of the space shuttle Challenger (D.Vaughan, 1996). However, it is just the surface cause of the accident. The deep reason behind is the insufficient low-temperature testing of O-ring which conceals the potential risk from engineers. It is not an excuse for them to quibble that they have no idea of the quality of O-ring because they have not collected sufficient data to prove that the O-ring cannot stand low temperature. It is a problem of engineers' attitude that no one bothers to detect that 'apparent' problem. Unfortunately, the launch date of the Challenger space shuttle was extremely cold and this error turned out to be fatal (McConnell, M, 1987).": 1571, "Furthermore, almost all nuclear related accidents were linked to human error which can be eliminated with the use of automation. Besides eliminating human errors in operating a nuclear plant, the automatic system will mean that no operators will be endangered as all processes, including emergency procedures, will be done automatically. In principle, the GIV reactors are \"meltdown proof\" with its multiple automatic backup systems. And even in the case of an accident, it will be cooled down automatically (Butler, 2004). The Chernobyl was an accident waiting to happen, the early model of the Soviet reactor which had no containment vessels were no longer operating. The safety performance of nuclear plant has improved through the years. From about 2 safety-significant events reported per plant per year to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1990, the number has improved to less than one tenth of that by 2000 (Lake, 2009).

Allowing them to know will serve as a warning for them to take preventive measure or prepare for the worst as well as readying family members for the possibility that the condition associated with the genetic abnormality may one day surface. Despite the arguments of privacy of the individual, feelings of helplessness, possible family tension and increasing the level of stress within a family, I still feel that the moral obligation to let the carrier's relatives know far outweighs these points.

Although there may be many valid concerns, VHTR is the best in safety and performance. However we should not be complacent and continue to improve and foresee future problems that the VHTR may develop in the future, so that Nuclear Energy continues to be viable and safe. Presently, they should look into the problem of cooling agents, as well as other alternatives for Uranium. These reactors are likely to be relied on as a possible source of energy for at least the next two to three decades (James, 1996). Other than such technical problems we should also look into the possible human misuse in Nuclear Energy and take caution not to let any disaster happen.": 310, "Nuclear reactor produces a large amount of energy relative to the average fossil fuel combustion. The amount of nuclear energy given off is huge in a typical nuclear reaction, amounting to an average of 3.4 thousand billion joules per kilogram of fuel, which is about one hundred thousand times as much energy as the combustion of fuel (Gene Smith, 1999). With human population rising at an exponential rate, peaking at an estimated 9.1 billion in 2050, energy consumption is too expected to rise proportionally. Nuclear is definitely a viable option that can meet this demand.": 1576, "Some of the issues raised by concerned groups stem from either misunderstanding of the technology and its capabilities or by simple inaccurate facts. Both of these roots are evidences that RFID community has done a poor job at conveying to the public, in an accurate understandable form, what technology is and its capabilities. Education will be a key component in the acceptability, progress and evolution of RFID technology. (RFID Applied(pp. 280-282)) Meanwhile, some hold that it should be banned since it intrudes people's privacy. Apparently, such surveillance technology should be strictly restricted for its potential disadvantages. However, it should not be banned. We will lose all its advantages and benefits once such technology is banned, which will lead to more casualty and threat to society. Furthermore, science and technology development in such areas will be barricaded once we ban, which affects human society and civilization further.": 1577, "Thirdly, the VHTR employs stringent security measures to combat intruders. The whole perimeter is under 24 hour surveillance by armed guards. Furthermore, in an event of a nuclear leak, they have a system distributing iodine pills to residents within a 10 mile radius. Though these are impressive, the round-the-clock security cannot protect against attacks like crashes and the time taken to deliver the pills may be far too long to prevent much damage. The MSR however, employs measures such that little or no fissile materials are emitted. The MSR is highly protected from nuclear proliferation due to its clever waste recycling of fission materials. It converts Uranium-233 into unusable fissile material by adding Thorium. This cycle bypasses the stage where Plutonium-239 is produced. (Andre, 2009) Instead it produces a variety of Plutonium isotopes that cannot be used to make nuclear weapons. Without weapons grade plutonium in the purest form, it reduces the effectiveness of explosions. U-233 is more radioactive compared to the conventional U-235 used today. As a result, the usage of U-233 has also posed concerns to both staff working in the MSR. More funding is needed to safeguard the staff handling fissile material. U-233 also damages electronics, and thus, not feasible in a bomb.

One such change would be to make new decisions for family planning. Due to the lack of treatment strategies of some genetic disorders, a carrier might have a short lifespan. Therefore, it is both ewill bential to plan for an early retirement or to start a family. A carrier could devise a financial plan so that one would havmayufficient monetary resources to support oneself even after an early retirement. One main objection to starting a family is that the affected genes or chromosomes might be passed on to the children. This, however, can be prevented using an expensive technology, Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) such as pre-implantation of genetic diagnosis whereby \"only unaffected embryos are allowed to develop to term\" (Norrgard, 2). Thus, a carrier could still start a family without passing the genetic disorder to the children. Furthermore, this could lead to another constructive change for the carrier's relatives. For relatives who are planning to have children, they must either be financially prepared for ART as well as the future medical bills, or choose not to have children. As for those who already have children, they must also be financially prepared. On top of that, they would have to choose the right time to convey to their children that they might be carriers of a certain genetic disorder. These changes and preparations cannot be achieved overnight, and therefore, revealing a known genetic risk to one's relatives is necessary.": 1584, "from http:// www.iaea.org/inisnkm/nkm/htgr/fulltext/29026666.pdf.": 320, "The vast and most frequent surveillance is on the internet, the presumed free space. (Daffier, Whitfield, 2008))For instance, the information awareness office, NSA, FBI in U.S. all have unauthorised access to all the data and traffic on the internet. Billions are spent every year to develop, purchase, maintain and implement the surveillance system to intercept and analyze online information. The tapping of telephone line by government organisations for monitor citizens and collecting miscellaneous information is also widespread in almost every country. Another common surveillance system is that of the surveillance cameras hidden in public areas such as streets, hotels, hospital, shopping mall, bank etc, for administrative purposes or financial security. RFID tapping is the use of small devices implanted in human body or product to identify and locate, which is already applied in some company to monitor their workers while on the job .": 1585, "With the demand for energy increasing, it is urgent to find an economy and efficient energy source. Nuclear power is inevitably becoming one of the most important supplies. As a generation IV reactor, the molten salt reactor has outstanding safety advantage in both reactor and reprocessing, and it is profitable in a long run. Hence, it will be reasonable and wise to support the research.": 1586, "What will be this world if people are capable of viewing their genetic testing results as easily as ordering a dinner in a restaurant? Nowadays, there is a new type of technology, named genetic testing, which is designed to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders (Genetic testing, 2009). With the help of genetic test, people are able to find or rule out some suspected genetic problems and will be clear about the risks of developing or passing on a genetic disorder. However, if diagnosed withare allowed to have the final say in revealing the results of such testing, although it has many benefits, its disadvantages still outweigh these advantages overwhelmingly. That is to say, letting people possess the right to view such testing results is potentially harmful to our community. Hence, people should not have the final say in whether to reveal the result of genetic tests. This essay will concentrate on two aspects to illustrate the reasons: side effects of the genetic testing on families and society (Nicholson, 2007).": 1587, "In addition, better technology will lower the unit cost of generating nuclear power. For example, the US has not built any new nuclear plants for the last two decades, yet the amount of electricity produced from nuclear has increased by about 8% annually as the industry becoming more efficient (Lake). Very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR), one of the concepts of GIV reactor, will be operating at around 1000 C instead of the 330 C in current model of reactors. With higher operating temperature, efficiency of the plant will be increased.

This accident happened on April 26, 1986, when the Number 4 reactor of the nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine exploded. The result is that 300 Megacarriers of radioactive isotopes was injected into the atmosphere and millions of people died immediately or consequently. More than twenty years have passed while an issue has always been controversial, which is whether the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident. In other word, if we can clear all the human factors of the accident, would the accident be prevented?": 321, "First of all, opponents state that nuclear power has some safety problems. First, they say that the generation IV actors are very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR), which react in both high temperature and pressure. It is very dangerous because nuclear reactors are very likely to explode under the condition of high temperature and pressure. Second, the key element of the nuclear power Plutonium is a radioactive metal element, which would release large number of radiation in decay and reactions. The radiation would do harm to human health in the long-term study. Whereas, to the problem of high temperature and pressure, scientist put forward some corresponding improvements in generation IV reactors. First, we take fluoride salts as the coolant for molten salts reactors in the reactions. The fluoride salts are \"thermodynamically stable (i.e., they do not decompose upon heating)\" and have the good effect of cooling CITATION WFo07 \\l 2052 (W.Forsberh, Peterson, & Zhao, 2007). Moreover, comparing with other generation IV reactors like Gas-cooled fast reactors and Supercritical-water-cooled reactors, the pressure for molten salts reactors is low. Furthermore, the molten salts reaction facilities are made of thick reinforced concrete. Reinforced concrete has the characters of firmness and anti high temperature. This kind of material can absorb radiation produced by the plutonium, so that the radiation will be greatly reduced. Therefore, the high temperature and pressure in process and radioactivity of the element are not big problems to affect nuclear power research.": 1590, "3.An EcoGeneration Solutions LLC.

Therefore, we can tap on the use of safer nuclear energy earlier. This is mainly thanks to the fact that sodium-cooled reactors are already in operation in Japan and Russia (US DOE NERAC/GIF 2002). Thus, less research will be required for the SFR, which also means that the research cost will be reduced. Furthermore, by choosing the SFR's proven method of cooling the nuclear core, it removes the uncertainties of using new and untested technology which are present in the other reactors. The SFR is also chosen by the United States as their front runner for generation IV fast reactors due to its strong technology basis (US DOE/NE 2006).": 1591, "[2] U.S. DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee and the Generation IV International Forum.

As a result Government use of either increase or decrease of taxes could benefit the ageing population. Since there is economic growth, government would have more resources and hence require less taxes, as a consequence a family would be able to increase its spending on its older members. On the other hand the state could also receive more taxes now that people have increased income and use the money for further betterment of the healthcare system.

Although there is an ethical obligation to disclose the results to one's family so that constructive life changes can be made, there currently is no legal requirement to do so. Furthermore, the disclosure can cause negative social consequences such as potential discrimination. In my opinion, since the decision of an individual to undergo genetic testing is voluntary, they have already had the \"final say\" to decide whether they want their potential disorders to be revealed hence, the individual should not have the final say only after the test as long as they have signed the agreement under well informed circumstances and that the disclosure is only made to relevant third parties.": 1593, "Davenport, J. 2007 Sep 19.

Sociologists note that relatives of carriers of known genetic risks may be denied application of health insurance policies or have to pay higher premiums since they are at higher risk of developing the disease (Health Plan One, n.d.). This is because insurance companies being mostly profit-orientated would predict any possible added costs and take pre-emptive actions to avoid these costs. In addition, healthy and qualified relatives of carriers may be denied employment opportunities (American Medical Association, 1991). Employers may have the misguided belief that they have to pay more money in order to ensure the working environment is safe for these employees. The consideration of medical leaves that these employees may take in future may deter the employers from engaging their services for fear of loss in efficiency at work and trouble in finding replacements. As such, companies will not tend to employ individuals who have medical history of genetic diseases. However, these arguments fail to consider the measurements in place to protect insurance and employability for relatives of carriers. Paddock (2008) asserted that the enactment of laws such as the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act 2008 in the United States would prohibit insurance companies to reject policies due to genetic information and forbid companies to use genetic information for hiring decisions for individuals. Moreover, a mathematical model to work out the extra mortality for individuals associated with higher risks of illnesses such as Hungtinton's disease will guide insurance companies to formulate reasonable amount of premiums (Watts, 1999).

A hybrid nuclear reactor known as the International Thermal Nuclear Reactor (ITER) is currently being developed in France. ITER has significant benefits over the current class IV reactors, it produces less nuclear waste and is more efficient in its production of electricity this could indirectly mean that cost of producing electricity with the use of the hybrid reactors will be much cheaper. ITER produces neutron as its waste which could be burned up rapidly (Gerstner, 2009). While the class IV reactors, produces nuclear waste that contains plutonium and uranium, they incurred a high reprocessing cost and till have 4% of the original nuclear waste left over. Almost all of the nuclear waste that could not be reprocessed are being buried in landfill sites that could take million of years to decompose and also contaminate the land rendering it useless for other purposes. This cost of reprocessing nuclear waste makes up the bulk of the maintenance cost incurred. The ITER could do without the need to reprocess its nuclear waste and therefore could bring the cost down of producing electricity. Another more significant advantage is the performance of the ITER, being able to produce ten times the power as compared to previous versions. The ITER utilizes a new technology to contain the nuclear material in a doughnut shaped ring surrounded by a strong magnetic to stabilize the nuclear material thus enhancing its stability and efficiency.

With the company and cooperation of family members, constructive lifestyle modification such as adopting healthy diet, exercising as well as reducing alcohol and cigarette consumption can be easily implemented. Thus, revealing one's genetic condition to family members are proven to be an anecdote to sufferings from psychological pressures more beneficiary as compared to concealing the truth.": 1622, "Nuclear energy is a source of energy which originates from the splitting of uranium atoms in a process called fission. At the power plant, the fission process is used to generate heat for producing steam, which is used by a turbine to generate electricity. (Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, 2009) Nuclear energy started in 1942. Till date, there are 436 active nuclear power plants and they generate more than 370,221 Megawatts of electricity which constitute to 16% of the world's total energy consumption. Nuclear energy is used because it does not produce carbon dioxide which causes greenhouse effect. Also, nuclear energy does not rely on oil and coal which are limited resources and its energy generation is the most concentrated compared to other sources of energy. Despite the benefits of nuclear energy, few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades in many countries due to public opposition. Nuclear leak is the fear that most people have after the Bhopal incident which occurred in 1984. It continues to evoke strong emotions even after 25 years later.

As mentioned, an ageing population has high demands for medications and social care services. Through research and development, it is said that the government should support these demands. However, a limit has to be established so that spending is not extravagant. It is also vital that a perspective is set on the government not being the sole agent to relieve the ageing process. Private practices in healthcare professionals, social care services and organizations for citizens also correspond to the aged. In Singapore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong implemented that healthcare system will be restructured for the ageing population. For instance, he said one key step is to link up acute hospitals with community ones where patients can receive treatment at the acute hospital and then recuperate at the community hospital (Channel NewsAsia, 2009).": 1627, "As the mankind has entered the 21 century, the need for fuel has become increasingly pressing, which has exceeded the amount of fuel required in the past century by most 50 percent. To solve the complex function of the world's need for more fuel, the solution lies in, as suggested by scientists and engineers worldwide, the generation IV nuclear reactors, which are capable of generating the power needed at a far more efficient rate compared to the contemporary power plants. There are altogether six designs for the generation IV reactors while this essay will focus on one of them named very-high-temperature reactor or VHTR in short and expound on the reasons why it is worth all the researches and money put into it. Generation IV reactors are designed to achieve certain goals, some of which involve generating clean and efficient energy, replacing fossil fuel and increasing resource utilization. The VHTR is specially designed to achieve these goals because it can withstand core temperature as high as 1000 degrees, even the highest among all the generation IV reactors. Having established some common understanding of the VHTR, there are basically three reasons why the VHTR should receive continuous funding and research. First and the most concerned reason of all is that the VHTR gresearcha high degree of safety. Being graphite-moderated and helium-cooled, it doesn't melt easily due to the extremely high melting point of graphite nor does it allow any corrosion of the chamber as helium is a very inert gas which is resistant to reactions that lead to corrosive substances. This property should well fend off the critics using the meltdown accidents that happened at Three Mile Island and Ukraine, as the possibility of such accidents happening to a reactor able to function properly at 1000 degrees is insignificant. Secondly, the VHTR produces energy in a very efficient manner. The VHTR allows for more than 50% of more electricity to be produced from the same amount of fuel intake compared to the conventional reactors. It burns up to 65% of uranium compared to only 5% for conventional reactors. As the non-renewable resources are running out, the VHTR provides an excellent alternative solution to energy generation. Thirdly, the VHTR produces a by-product, hydrogen gas, which is considered as another environmental-friendly source of energy. At high temperature (700-900), H2 is split from water and can be further utilized as fuel for transportation and factories. This reduces burning of fossil fuels, like oil, which generates toxic gases. This property, which can never be reached by the current reactors, serves to preserve the environment by replacing the contaminating fossil fuels using hydrogen gas.": 1628, "However, some people say that the accident was caused due to human error. Upon realising that there was a crisis, the aircraft crew of each vessel responded without much consideration as to what their actions might lead to. People then blamed the cause of the accident on the aircraft crew of both sides for badly managing the situation.": 339, "Secondly, genetic testing allows oneself to be prepared upon knowing that a relative of theirs has a genetic risk. This will allows them to take precautious and preventive measures about their health condition. Some diseases that can be detected by genetic testing like Marfan syndrome - a connective tissue disorder causing long limbs and heart defects (Haldeman- Englert, C., May 15, 2008) can be controlled and treated. When the other family members or relatives have an early detection of such diseases like Marfan syndrome, they are able to take preventive measures early like consulting a doctor, take medications that could slow down the heart rate in order to prevent stress on the aorta and avoid having sports in prevention of injuring the heart (Haldeman-Englert, C., May 15, 2008).": 1629, "Leipoldt, John (2007). \"There are Advantages of Nuclear Energy As There are": 340, "Nevertheless, the first reason that the public is concerned over the funding of generation IV nuclear reactors is that the nuclear reactors will not reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions as compared to natural gas and oil use (Nature, 2008). However, this is not the case as there are countries constructing nuclear reactors because it can indeed improve the environment. For example, reducing greenhouse-gas emissions is the main reason for the endorsement of the construction of nuclear reactors by the UK government (Nature, 2008). Furthermore, according to Butler (2004), the SCWR does not emit carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse-gas that is soaring because of natural gas and oil generated power plants. Therefore, such generation IV reactors will certainly improve the environment and should be funded for their research and development.": 1630, "Secondly, RFID helps to reduce and solve crimes. RFID can be used to monitor people who may pose a threat to society. Knowing that they are being spied on, they will have less tendency to commit crimes. Prison violence was reduced by up to 60% in some United States prisons that had RFID installed (Kanellos, 2004). Furthermore, data retrieved from RFID readers can serve as evidence against suspects to solve crimes (Kanellos, 2004). Opponents of RFID technology argue that implanted RFID tags cause cancer. Implanted RFID tags were observed to cause tumours in laboratory animals (Albrecht, 2007). This concern is not necessary, because external tags can be used.

However, he explained that the U.S. could store the waste near the reactors. Naturally, that is possible as the waste is about 33 tonnes per year (Wald, August 2009) and this relatively small amount of waste should find the space at those nuclear sites. Moreover the impact of global warming is growing and is of immediate concern to the world and nuclear power help solve the problem by reducing the emission of carbon dioxide by a total of 31,243 MtC in 2050 in France and Canada alone.(Cochran, 23 April 2008).

It is true that to develop and build a nuclear plant will cost a lot of money, but the cost is reasonable. Nuclear power technology is much more well-rounded and practical technology when compared to solar power or bio-power technology. A lot of money is also spent on developing these technologies which are still in experimental stage. According to a recent report of nuclear plants (European Nuclear Society, 2009), until 24 September 2009, there are 436 nuclear power plant units in 31 countries are in operation and 53 plants in 15 countries are under construction. About 17% of the world's electricity came from nuclear plants. It is obvious that spending more money on development of nuclear power is quite reasonable. Moreover, the performance of a nuclear plant is very significant compared to conventional thermal power station. They both used the same principle to generate electricity. Finally, under normal operation, nuclear power plants are environmental-friendly. It does not emit any carbon dioxide gases or other pollutions. The only thing to care about is the radiation. The plant can ensure there will be no radiation emitted out of the reactor under normal operation.": 1638, "Secondly, tracking people may trackn privacy crisis, which can cause more serious problems.

After the incident occurred, the reactor was modified to have much lower positive void coefficient. From this point, it showed that the reactor was an error design product. Furthermore, the accident could have been prevented if designer had done it right at the beginning. As Wilpert (2007) suggested, psychology, in fact, could help the design process to consider on how human mistakes could be prevented or at least reduced.

Population ageing is experienced in most industrialized countries, and it has certainly affected these countries' productivity as it brings along problems such as rising social and welfare costs. It can also result in a shrinking and less efficient workforce, and a growing burden on family support. Therefore, to tackle the problems brought about by the ageing process, there is a role for the individual, the family, and most importantly, the state to play. We look specifically in the case of Singapore's approach: current research and development (R\"D) and policies such as the employment policies, the public pensions programs and the health care and community development prepared for the aged have greatly helped in easing the problems posed by the ageing process. Employment policies in the form of encouraging the hiring or re-hiring of the elderly and in strengthening the workforce by bringing in more immigrants are ways to solve the problem of low productivity in the economy caused by the ageing process. In the case of Singapore, the state has for example, extended the retirement ages for its people to 62, and to 65 by 2012. This gives the elderly an opportunity to work to supplement his/her own expenses, and it also helps in raising the productivity of the workforce as well. Another way to make up for the lack of productivity of the workforce is to encourage more immigrants or 'foreign talents' to work in Singapore. The state's readiness to provide financial benefits or aids to 'foreign talents', and the conducive and attractive work environment that Singapore provides meant that these people are able to replace the elderly in the workforce and maintain, or even bring the economy to higher levels. Thus, employment policies have made the problems associated with the ageing process much negligible. Another method that the Singapore government has adopted to deal with the ageing process is the use of the public pensions programs, more familiar to Singaporeans by the name of Central Provident Fund (CPF). More commonly seen as a social security savings plan, contributions are made monthly to the CPF by working Singaporeans and their employers. In such a case, these savings can then be used appropriately, especially after retirement. It helps to see the elderly through their retirement, provides a retirement income for the elderly and it ensures sufficient savings for future medical uses as one gets older. The CPF policy has seen tremendous success in providing one with sufficient income for rainy days and future uses, and it certainly has lessen the impacts that the ageing process has brought about. And finally, the state has also implemented policies on health care and community development such as health care insurance schemes and improving facilities and infrastructure for the elderly. Health care insurance schemes such as the Medisave, Medishield and Eldershield allows Singaporeans to place aside part of his/her own income for health care needs in the future. This greatly encourages independence among the elderly in the future, and also on the emphasis of personal responsibility. This reduces the burden on the family brought about by the ageing process. R\"D has also allowed the state to improve public infrastructure, such as the creation of wheelchair-accessible buses, upgrading the houses such as the provision of lifts for access to every storey, and the development of retirement housings. An awareness of more elderly-friendly programs and facilities can also be made through advertisements. As such, the elderly need not be as reliant on the community as before. Thus, there need not be more burdens on the family and the community brought about by the ageing process. However successful these policies may turn out to be, there are still contestations as to whether these policies are truly effective, and how it may actually bring in other sets of problems. For example, the policy of bringing in more 'foreign talents' has brought disputes from locals in claiming that there is too much competition for jobs in Singapore. And certainly, when implemented on its own, each policy presents its own sets of problems. In providing employment for the elderly, its effects may be reduced if the health conditions or attitudes of these elderly workers are not seen to. The CPF policy may provide cover for the elderly, but they will not be able to use it wisely if the state does not provide useful information or advices in its usage. Therefore, the abovementioned policies will not be as effective as when it is implemented on its own; it needs to supplement each other for it to work. The ageing process can be a tough and tumultuous time for the elderly, in terms of their well being and financial stability. Certainly, without the policies undertaken by the state, the graying population will bring about problems found both in the economy and at home. Thus, policies such as the employment policies, the social security savings plan and health care and community development have helped to ease the ageing process by allowing the elderly to enjoy a more vibrant and active life in both social and economical aspects. These policies are also most effective when working in tandem, whereas on its own its impacts are limited. The Singapore government has done well in its foresight of the problems regarding the ageing process, but more can be done to achieve better value of integration between the private and public spheres. As for now, its policies have certainly kept the ageing process a much manageable one.": 348, "Solomon, C. H and Knowlton, E (n.d). Hazard and Operability studies (HAZOP).

As a result, the VHTR need not use liquid to gas exchangers, unlike the MSR. However, heat is hard to contain and is easily lost to the environment. The VHTR is a thermal reactor while the MSR is a fast reactor. In a thermal reactor, fast neutrons are slowed down to produce heat. In a fast reactor, it optimises the high speeds of the neutrons instead. Since it would be practical to use the already fast speeds of the neutrons, slowing them down will produce a lot of heat in the VHTR. The MSR, though it includes the liquid to gas exchanger, this generates $4.5 mil per percentage increase in efficiency.

The researchers who are in favour of VHTR argue that the resource of VHTR, helium - an inertia gas with low chemical activity is much safer than sodium, the coolant of SFR. If the sodium leaks from the core then there could be a tremendous explosion. This could be a serious threat to safety. Although it is true that sodium is relatively active, there is an extra loop in the SFR producing process in order to prevent the accident (Carlsson, Tucek, &Wider, 2005). Moreover, there are several cycles in the process of SFR and each individual is segregated. Therefore it is hardly that the reactor will leak. Besides the chemical behavior, the operating condition is another element responsible for the safety. According to Carlsson, Tucek and Wider's conclusion (2005), the probability of incurring the accident of losing coolant is proportional to the operating temperature and pressure. VHTR requires quite high operating temperature at 1000 Celsius and pressure. On the contrary, SFR is best performed under low pressure and only 350 to 500 Celsius degree (Butler, 2004). Hence the operating conditions make the SFR practically safe as a result of the low possibility of incurring the losing coolant accident. Lastly, there is no separate plutonium generated in all processes of SFR, which is a highly radioactive and toxic element. As a result, the proliferation can be controlled.": 1650, "A correct design at the beginning stage is very important to prevent accident. Most of the accidents occurred because of human errors either done by operators or even designer at the design stage. As design engineers and operators are human beings, psychology could have been integrated in the design process to analyse possible errors from the design and human behaviours. Moreover, with psychology knowledge, a design engineer would be capable of predicting the situation under worse condition. Hence, system would be incorporated with proper safety features to prevent accident.": 350, "Public concerns over safety and nuclear proliferation have retarded the growth of nuclear technology. According to Butler (2004), \"the partial reactor meltdown in 1979 at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, and the 1986 accident at Chernobyl in Ukraine\" have convinced the public that nuclear technology is extremely dangerous. Besides, there were questions over proliferation of uranium and plutonium waste to generate Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Moreover, renewable energy technologies such as wind, biomass, geothermal and solar energy have proven to be effective in achieving electricity production with small carbon footprints (MIT, 2009). However, on the other hand, the Generation IV International Forum envisions nuclear as the best alternative for coal and has proposed six best prospects for the reactors of the future, known as Generation IV reactors (Butler,2004). Amongst all, the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) proves to be promising with advantages such as passive safety, flexibility, higher efficiency and non-proliferation of nuclear waste. The VHTR should thus be accepted as the next generation of reactor and funds should be allocated for the research and development of the VHTR.": 351, "As we mention the simple design above, many people's common opposing view is that lacking some kinds of designs may cause some unexpected dangers, since the design is still on paper. But we should have known that we do not just use water as coolant only this time in SCWR. In fact, many generation III reactors, such as advanced pressurized water reactor (APWR), advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR), economic simplified boiling water reactor (ESBWR), involve water as coolant. The design and structure of the reactor are quite similar, and therefore we are very experienced in the design. This system, as I mentioned before, presents unique features combining well-known fast and light water reactor characteristics in one design. The eliminated design like circulation pumps, steam generators and steam separators would not affect the safety factor at all, while the eliminated pressurizers and dryers may affect a little.

Thus, the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing.": 354, "Ageing population is a fact. It is foremost a consequence of the \"baby boom\" - the rapid increase in birth rates and then its decline after the Second World War.1 This period of increased fertility lasted for thirty years and the number of people born in this era was unusually large. Population ageing has also been intensified by increases in life expectancy at older ages because of education, improved healthcare, and technology. Such demographic changes might bring about severe consequences, most importantly national budgets might be under pressure as growing number of elderly persons are supported fewer younger persons. The debate now is whether the nation state should limit its public spending so that the saved resources can be utilised to other areas f the country's development. In this brief essay I would strongly argue that yes, the state should indeed limit its spending and focus more on economic growth so as to not to discriminate against the elderly but rather to aid them in a more fruitful way which is beneficial for both generations. I believe that economic growth has its \"trickle down\" effect and accompanies numerous positive externalities which would help the old even more efficient way than continuous increase in healthcare spending which restrains GDP growth.": 1656, "By 2030, the world demand for energy is predicted to rise by about 50 percent and by 2050, it will be doubled. This prediction indicates that we need to find alternative source of energy in order to continue our daily life. Clearly, it seems that the nuclear power is a good alternative. However when we talk about nuclear, people will usually associate it with radiation, wastes and missiles. Also public opposition was given as one reason why few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades in many countries. With the increasing demand for energy and prices for fossil fuel, the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) comes out with the new concepts of the Generation IV nuclear reactors. These reactors have the potential to provide safe base-load electric power with negligible pollutants (Hansen, 2008). Out of the six generation IV reactor concepts, I consider that the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is one of the best concepts for further development of nuclear reactor.": 1657, "Secondly, from an environmental standpoint, the opposing views think that the life-cycle emissions of the nuclear energy are the great pollutants. However, several analyses have shown that the life-cycle emissions are far less than those of coal or natural gas-fired power plants (Nuclear Energy: A key tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, n. d). Furthermore, in fact 15% electricity globally which generated by nuclear power greatly reduces the amounts of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere every year by 2.1 billion tonnes (Position Paper, n.d). And the nuclear plants emit hardly any key agents for acid rain and photochemical air pollution, the sulphur dioxide or nitrogen oxides.

In order to improve the overall efficiency of the medical team, Tan Tock Seng Hospital has rolled out RFID in 2007 to monitor more than 1,200 patients (Friedlos 2009). The benefits of RFID includes locating the patients easily for tests and administering of medicine, and a lower response time of the housekeeping department in clearing the bed once a patient is discharged, which will then reduce an individual's waiting time for a bed (Friedlos 2009). This surveillance technology has allowed the healthcare professionals to perform their jobs efficiently and improve the well-being of the patients. However, as the population continues to age, elderly who are not seriously ill might have to be discharged and nursed their injuries or illnesses at home or in a nursing home (Tan 2007). In order not to compromise their health, RFID should be utilized to monitor them (Broache 2007).

However, Lane (2003) argues that due to the limited range of RFID, it will not serve the purpose of locating the kidnapped child well. On top of that, Lane (2003) also pointed out that these surveillance technologies may give the children and parents a false sense of security.

Emotional outcomes after predictive genetic testing such as increased measures of anxiety, anger, depression, guilt and redemptive adjustments are psychologically destructive (Davies, Donnai, MacLeod, McAllister, Nicholls & Payne, 2007). Moreover, scientific researches provide substantial evidences showing that the frequency of catastrophic outcomes such as suicide, attempted suicide and psychiatric hospitalization are significantly higher amongst those receiving Huntington's disease predictive-testing results (Almqvist, Bloch, Brinkman, Craufurd & Hayden, 1999). The devastative psychological effects on risk-prone individuals can be reduced if family members show moral support and intensive care. In fact, the risk and severity of certain adult onset genetic disorders can be alleviated by preventative measures and treatments. With the company and cooperation of family members, constructive lifestyle modification such as adopting healthy diet, exercising as well as reducing alcohol and cigarette consumption can be easily implemented.

One of the most advanced concepts is the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) which incorporates maximum safety features and produces more energy than expected (Burtler, 2004). More research should be done on the VHTR reactor because currently, the expected cost of operating this VHTR reactor is still relatively high. However, the cost is still cheaper in contrast to using fossil fuels to generate energy. For example, the cost of nuclear energy per kilo watt hour (KWh) is just 1.68 cents only. This is much cheaper compared to using oil which cost 18 cents per KWh or using coal which cost about 4 cents per KWh (Economics of Nuclear Power, 2009). The low cost of nuclear energy is mainly due to the abundance of uranium which can be mined at a low cost and just a tiny amount of uranium can provide a huge amount of nuclear energy for usage. However, for fossil fuels, the most optimistic estimate on the lasting for fossil fuels is about two hundred years (Enzler, 1998). Cost is definitely an issue for people.

The efficiency of the VHTR can reach to 50% because it adopts a very high operating temperature which is 1000 (the generation 4 international forum, 2002). At this high temperature the rate of the reaction will dramatically increase and much more energy will be released from the same amount of fuel. Another great benefit under the extremely high temperature reactors is that the reactors can be used to split hydrogen from water thermochemically.

Thus, they should be informed about the risk of having disorders. Being aware of it, they may choose to go through some genetic tests to check whether the disorder presents (Scientific American, 2008). If the result is positive, then they will receive necessary treatments. Although we haven't found how to cure many of such diseases yet, if it is detected soon, the life of the patient can be lengthened. Some people can claim that knowing that we are having a high risk of having, for example, a type of cancer while we may not have it can make people more anxious (Cancer.net, 2009) . In fact, the reactions of people with disorders are different (Cancer.net, 2009) thus we may not be diagnosed to have a cancer since we were young but it may present when we are at the middle age. Knowing more about a risk of having a disease may help people to be more aware of its phenomenon, as well as more concern on their health (Cancer.net, 2009). They may have medical check-up more frequently and if there is any disorder that can threaten their life, it will be identified soon and it is always better when we can control a disease when it hasn't become worse.

This means that personal health information is known to everyone in the family tree including those relatives that one is not close to. Hence, one might not feel secured to disclose their genetic testing results to their family members. Admittedly, letting family members know about the genetic risk might cause families to be even more united and they will have a better understanding about their inherited genes.

Thus it is absolutely vital morally for the affected individual to inform his relatives of his genetic disorder, so as to prepare his relatives psychologically, medically and financially. Thus the carrier is not only being responsible to himself, but also to his relatives and even future generations. However, critics might want to argue that his relatives will alienate him, and thus making the individual feel isolated and uncared for. I believe that despite risking alienation, the moral responsibility in telling his relatives of the problem is more important than the former as it will give his relatives adequate warning about the potential risk that might affect them too.": 1692, "Security issue against terrorist and use of nuclear weapon is a major concern when we think about nuclear power.

There are cases which the main reason for surgical failure is that the surgeries did not carry out in time. Does not it sound pity to you? In many cases lives of the patients can be saved if the surgeries did carry out on time.

United States prohibits reprocessing and also encourages countries not to reprocess the waste materials (Butler, 2004). Reactor technologies such as Gas-Cooled and Molten Salt Reactors involve reprocessing which is not suitable with current regulations about plutonium.

Therefore, it clears the concerns of public as well as governments around the world.": 376, "Firstly, the critics claim that the operation of nuclear plant is dangerous because of the only one accident happened in Cheryl in history. The radioactivity escaped from one overheated core into the atmosphere, and caused 28 people to die, 134 people to sick and about 70 cases of thyroid cancer in children. However, such an accident will not happen again, that is because nowadays allwhich is generated by nuclear power globallyperation worldwide are placed inside a containment building. Unfortunately, the reactor in Chernobyl was not in such an infrastructure. The containment building helps to keep the radiation inside in the case of the faulty operation of the reactor. Its ability to prevent the leak of radiation was proved in 1979, at Three Mile Itonnes, the reactor core meltdown. It should have cause major impact to people living there, but in fact, no injuries or deaths occurred because of the presence of the containment building.( Donald W. Miller,2004).

Frankly speaking, this problem does exist, but we can view it from another perspective, which means comparing its cost with that of other kinds of power plants under all the same conditions. Firstly, the cost of constructing a nuclear reactor is at most 2 to 3 times than the cost of building a heat-energy reactor with the same output. But the raw material like uranium enrichment used for nuclear reactors is much cheaper with the same amount of energy output. In addition, unlike the heat-energy reactor, the gas emitted by the nuclear reactor during the operation has little influence on the environment and global warming.

He will be able to work towards acceptance of the fact that he might have the condition and be able to adapt easily to it in the event that the condition manifests; as opposed to the condition striking suddenly without prior warning. Furthermore, he will be able to also mentally prepare for any stigma or discrimination that he may face in society as it has been shown that identifying patients in need of psychosocial support will enhance effect on well being (Mind and cancer: does psychosocial intervention improve survival and psychological well- being?).

Some emphasize the significance of personal privacy, and show the concern of genetic discrimination. However, because the whole family shares the same set of genes, they have the right to know the result of the genetic test. For the carriers, telling the result to their families is not only showing their responsibility to the family and society, but also the best way to ensure they get the best care.": 1700, "Another concern about the safety issue is very common. The supercritical water reactor is working at much higher temperature(500\u00baC) and pressure than the generation III reactor(Butler, 2004). It is a dangerous operating temperature in the concept of today. In fact, due to the higher temperature and pressure, the reactor can, however, be safer. At first, the whole concept of the supercritical water reactor is based on the light water reactor which has already used for years. The technique is already mature. The supercritical water is also used in different areas for a long time, so that the supercritical water reactor can be a practical innovation and it is very safe. Secondly, as I mentioned above, the steam has the same density and can be mixed with the liquid, so that the whole moderator have the nearly same density everywhere. It will be much easier to control the pure liquid compared to the liquid mixed with the bubbles. Actually, these voids in the liquid are chaotic and can be very dangerous because that the liquid and the steam have totally different properties. Lastly, the special supercritical water property also makes other procedures can be easily controlled such as cooling part (Magnus, 2006). The supercritical water reactor can be safer compared to the light water reactor. There are still a lot of people worrying about the nuclear waste of the supercritical water reactor (U.S. Envioromental Protection Angency, 2004). Some of the reactors need to depend on the reprocessing nuclear waste which will separate the plutonium which can be used to make nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, the supercritical water reactor will not depend on the reprocessing nuclear waste, thus it will not separate the plutonium (Butler, 2004). Besides, the supercritical water reactor is can also be developed with a fast neutron spectrum due to the neutron will be only partly moderated in the supercritical water. Being a fast neutron reactor will split the long lived actinides, destroying the most long lived nuclear waste through nuclear transmutation, which will greatly reduce the nuclear waste it produces and increase the efficiency of the reactor (GIF, 2007). From these two points, we can see that the supercritical water reactor does well in dealing with the nuclear waste.": 1701, "Current nuclear generation(II and III) has been applied into different areas to generate secure and inexpensive electric energy. To further broaden the usage of nuclear power, the next generation of nucleargeneration IV is under discussion. Very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) belongs to one of the six generation IV reactors. Compared with other reactors, VHTR has the privilege of high efficiency and high security. Basic researches to establish the new nuclear energy system is taking progress, and inquiries and doubts are generated with regards to safety, feasibility and cost. The concerns from public have been a main obstacle for further advancement in nuclear research. These concerns are inevitable, however, not necessary after synthesizing all the aspects and having a better insights into it.": 1702, "Secondly, surveillance technology can be used by employers to monitor their employees during workinthe publics. This is very crucial as to ensure that the productivity and the efficiency of the banning are kept to a maximum. For ithe publice, employees might seem to be surfing the web for business purposes at all time, but what they are actually doing is personal business such as online banking, shopping and chatting. Skiving and loafing of empees cause compas to lose many man hours and resources. If the behaviour of employees at work is monitored, they will work more efficiently and contribute to the company. It has been argued that one's privacy might be invaded due to surveillance technology (Hrespects.d., p.2). However, monitoring can take place under suitable circumstances and to an appropriate extent as it is only installed at the working places. It has also been said that surveillance of employees can affect the relationship between employer and employees (Heathfield, n.d., p.2). However, this only applies to those minority spending most of the time online doing personal things and do not meet the company's goals. Using of surveillance technology has no impact for those focusing on work and doing the right thing (Heathfield, n.d., p.2). Furthermore, security issue is very essential for factories manufacturing coins and jewelleries. Surveillance cameras can trace the movement of the workers. Suspicious behaviour by the employees can be reviewed by their employers through the electronic records. This can alleviate the theft rate in the factories. As a result, surveillance technology can facilitate the employers to monitor their workers with an extent of not breaching their privacy. Moreover, surveillance technology is vital in ensuring the safety of public. Through video and satellite surveillance, polices can track the movement of dangerous criminals and terrorists. Besides that, tracking of missing or kidnapped children (Stump, 2008, para.1) is made possible too. With the help of CCTV cameras, the whole criminal processes can be recorded. By that time, polices are able to trace the culprits' physical appearance and vehicle's number. Then, the time taken to solve the criminal cases is tremendously reduced, compared with the crime not being recorded. The video recorded becomes a concrete proof to subject the culprits for sanction. Eventually, public security is guaranteed. On the other hand, for those having disease like Alzheimer's disease, surveillance technology facilitate in finding them out if they get lost in somewhere else. Similarly, those running away from home, possibly caused by family factors or mental problems, can be tracked via CCTV cameras in the shortest period. This prevents them from doing things that are unfavourable or irrational. Hence, public safety can be ensured by the utilization of surveillance technology.": 1704, "In addition, reviews of the accident reported, \"before the launch, the low temperature had prompted concern form engineers at Morton Thiokol.\" (Dick, 1986) Thiokol engineers found that the temperature was colder than 53\u00b0F (12\u00b0C) and they did not have enough data and experience to determine if the O-rings would work properly to seal joint. (Website) Unfortunately, even though the engineers told the supervisors of Morton Thiokol about this potential pitfall, their concern did not draw the full attention of the supervisors. If the supervisors of the company were more alert and far-sighted, they would have reported this concern and stopped the launch. Critics may say that since the SRBs already could not work in cold weather, the happening of the accident was just a matter of time.

Critics of this objection claim that our security will be at risk as the embedded secret codes can be cloned and thus allowing the hackers to enter the country illegally. While it is true that such an event may occur, but with the advancement of technology and tighter regulations, this problem can be rectified. Therefore, the use of biometrics passport will not only increase efficiency but also enhance security at the same time.

However, whether a carrier of such disease is obligated to tell his or her relatives has become a great concern since a last few years.

However, there are cases which one may not have the liberty to share the information with the family due to the unstable condition of another member. One may also resort to this in order not to further burden their loved one.

Besides, they are worried about that nuclear reactors would become a terrorist target because of the radioactive waste. Nevertheless, these terrible things won't happen in sodium-cooled fast reactors, because the reaction is within the core and the recycling is closed which means the recycling is not separated out. As a result, the percentage of plutonium in the waste is reduced effectively. Besides, the reprocessing can cut the final amount of waste produced. Moreover, the systems based on mixed uranium-plutonium oxide fuel are primarily under development in Japan, and their preferred recycle option is an advanced aqueous process; and metal-fuel cycle systems are under development in the United States which use a pyroprocessing recycle as the preferred fuel cycle option.

There are many types of genetic diseases such as the Down Syndrome, Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, hemophilia A, and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. However, genetic testing has raises numerous ethical issues; one of them concerning consent and confidentiality of the tested individual identified to be a carrier of a known genetic risk.

For instance, because of the limited time, the engineers working for Challenger space shuttle failed to comply with the criteria of producing individual high qualitative parts of the space shuttle (R. P. Feynman, 1996). In order to finish their tasks promptly, engineers threw away their occupational ethic. The basis of psychology is completing one's own task in high quality, yet this basic requirement is sometimes ignored by people, and consequently, extremely painful accident is triggered. The contrary viewpoints tend to attribute the O-ring problem to a simply technical failure that the 'factual account' of the accident is \"frozen, brittle O ring\" which causes the leakage of fuel and induces the exploration of the space shuttle Challenger (D.Vaughan, 1996). However, it is just the surface cause of the accident. The deep reason behind is the insufficient low-temperature testing of O-ring which conceals the potential risk from engineers. It is not an excuse for them to quibble that they have no idea of the quality of the O-ring because they have not collected sufficient data to prove that the O-ring cannot stand low temperature. It is a problem of engineers' attitude that no one bothers to detect that 'apparent' problem.

In such situations, it is impossible for both parties to have their rights. One will have to give up the right to absolute privacy to reap the benefits of the rights to feel safe and secure. Besides having absolute privacy is just an ideal. The practice of surveillance technology is necessary for the benefit of majority as it adopted to improve our quality of life.

Nowadays, RFID scanners are highly portable and have a further effective reading radollarsyed & Mohammad, 2008). Furthermore, there is no need for the tags to be scanned to retrieve the information (Syed & Mohammad, 2008). This implies that RFID tags can now be read without one's knowledge. As such, human privacy is being violated. This situation regarding violating human privacy worsened after the Food and Drug Admiquantitieson in the United States approved the human implants of RFID chips (Aly0its impracticality SB 362 into Law, para. 3). Many concerns have been raised regarding the privacy of people as they can now be easily tracked wherever they are due to the RFID technology implanted in them (Syed & Mohammad, 2008). On the other hand, some people may argue that RFID technology is a form of crime prevention. It makes the search for missing people much easier and this helps to deter criminals from committing crimes like kidnapping. However, a stop check will expose this sham reality. A criminal in a real scenario would not hesitate to capture his prey just because the target has a RFID chip inside him. RFID chips can be easily removed and a kidnapper would not think twice to cut the RFID chip out of a child to take out the implant. This in turn makes the child more vulnerable to injuries due to the use of RFID technology.

RFID tags are also used to monitor patients with Alzheimer's disease according to Kanellos (2004) to prevent them from getting lost. The RFID tags are broken once patients are discharged so the bed can be prepared for new patients so waiting time would be reduced. Consequently, if nurses did not break the tag, disorder might result since the bed is no longer occupied but the housekeeping team is not informed.

For instance, Sweden is moving out of the nuclear power industry within the next 10 years. Sweden is even committed by law to phase out its existing nuclear power plants (Fred Guterl, 2002). This indicates that the public support has declined in the recent years. One of the main reasons of the decline is due to the fact that the nuclear power plant might cause dangerous consequences when it malfunctions, due to its unstable nature. Secondly, the amount of radioactive waste emitted by the nuclear power plant is also harmful to the earth, and yet, these nuclear plants release large amounts of highly radioactive compound. Thirdly, the challenge faced by the countries to isolate the leftover, highly radioactive material discharged by the nuclear power plant is also a main reason why it is in decline.

Being a carrier of a genetic disease is quite common as Guggino and Stanton (2006) note that one in 20 Caucasians carries the gene for cystic fibrosis.

Hence, the carrier should be obligated to tell his or her relatives so that they may also be aware of their genetic risk of the disease. Critics may argue that the cost of conducting genetic testing is not justifiable and may not be accurate. However, accuracy of the test can be improved through the passage of time as technology nowadays is more sophisticated. Moreover, should the high cost of the testing compromise one's health or life? In conclusion, even though a carrier of a known genetic risk has the right to disclose his or her condition, the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages.

However, the claim is not true. Nuclear suppliers reported that the newer plants actually only require 10 to 40% of the price needed to build the first plant. Also, the generation IV reactors are researched as a consortium. Hence, the countries can benefit from Economies Of Scale and create Monopoly. This would bring profit for the reactors. Also, if nuclear power is not used, then the world's economy could not progress as the energy input is not met. Hence, there would be more loss to the world if production stops. Therefore, research and funding for Generation IV reactors is necessary (madslein, 2006).": 1772, "Oppositions have very good reasons to go against nuclear reactor developmfuelsespecially after the 911 incident and the Chernobyl disaster. After the possible candidatesdent, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) enforced strict rules and regulations on the nuclear power plants.

Another benefit tless costlyh this heighten security is the generation of more jobs helping to ease unemployment rate. NRC also requires the power plants to conduct regular security and evacuation exercises which will be closely monitored by NRC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). (Order Code RS21131, 2005) Furthermore, a decades-long test and analysis portrayed that actual radioactivity escaping from molten fuel is less than initial assumption as the nuclear activity slows down a lot when it is not in the internal structure of the reactor. Also the containment structures of modern reactors were designed to effectively prevent the escape of radioactivity even if it sustained severe damages.(Safety, 2008) These factors would certainly ease the minds of people worrying about the security and safety issues of nuclear reactors. In contrast to the two other alternative sources of energy, the cost of building a nuclear reactor is higher than a wind turbine or solar panel. Also since a wind turbine or solar panel are more unlikely to be in a terrorist's hit list than a nuclear plant, cost of maintaining security of them are relative less. But in contrast to what many people would think, even a generation III reactor used today have structures that can sustain a plane crashing into it. In addition, a MSR uses an integrated fuel cycle system where it uses its molten salts as its fuel as well as its coolant. (GIF, 2007) MSR has lower fissile inventories and no need to spend on ways to handle solid fuels. (Gen IV reactors, 2009) Moreover, newer advanced reactors have simpler designs which further reduce capital cost and they are more fuel efficient and safer. (Advanced Reactors, 2009) The construction of wind turbines and solar panels are very space consuming because of their low energy efficiency and they are unreliable as they are weather dependent. (Gibson, 2007) Although nuclear reactors too need large area of land space, the great energy output it has compensated for it. All the alternative energy mentioned are green compared to the burning of fossil fuels in terms of emission to environment. But some still feel that wind and solar energy are greener than nuclear energy due to the nuclear waste. Since the first generation of nuclear reactors, advancement in technology has greatly increased the fuel efficiency thus cutting down on the waste. (Gen IV Reactors, 2009) Furthermore, MSR's fuel doubles up as its coolant due to the good heat transportation properties of molten salts further reduce on the waste produced. Due to the nature of MSR, its waste has lower amount of radioactivity, safer due to passive cooling up to any size and very low fuel usage.

The researchers who are in favour of VHTR argue that the resource of VHTR, helium - an inertia gas with low chemical activity is much safer than sodium, the coolant of SFR. If the sodium leaks from the core then there could be a tremendous explosion. This could be a serious threat to safety. Although it is true that sodium is relatively active, there is an extra loop in the SFR producing process in order to prevent the accident (Carlsson, Tucek, &Wider, 2005). Moreover, there are several cycles in the process of SFR and each individual is segregated. Therefore it is hardly that the reactor will leak out. Besides the chemical behavior, the operating condition is another element responsible for the safety. According to Carlsson, Tucek and Wider's conclusion (2005), the probability of incurring the accident of losing coolant is proportional to the operating temperature and pressure. VHTR requires quite high operating temperature at 1000 Celsius and pressure. On the contrary, SFR is best performed under low pressure and only 350 to 500 Celsius degree (Butler, 2004). Hence the operating conditions make the SFR practically safe as a result of the low possibility of incurring the losing coolant accident. Lastly, there is no separate plutonium generated in all processes of SFR, which is a highly radioactive and toxic element. As a result, the proliferation can be controlled.": 1777, "Some opponents may think that VHTR would be very costly. However, recent research supports exactly the opposite conclusion. The cost for VHTR including fuels and materials, reactor systems, balance of plant, safety, design & evaluation and fuel cycle is relatively low.

This is a selfish thinking and is an illogical way of avoiding the problem.

An early detection of genetic disorders can be obtained by genetic testing in order for further and early treatments to be conducted. For example, genetic testing enables patients and their relatives who are at risk of developing genetic disorders but show no symptoms at the beginning, to predict the chances of them inheriting the genetic disorders (Goh, 2005). The predisposition of the relatives of affected patients towards the genetic disorders can also be predicted. When a genetic disorder that runs through a certain family is known, the extent of the genetic disorder can be obtained (Goh, 2005). Genetic information is not confined to one person but it could be related to more than one person such as tested patients' relatives. This enables healthcare profionals to know the extent of the genetic mutation in the genes and hence, provide advice or genetic counselling to patients and their relatives. However, this has also resulted in a raise of privacy and confidentiality concerns. The revelation of genetically tested patients' results may lead to discrimination by society (Mehlman, 1999). There is no guarantee that relatives of genetically tested patients will keep the genetic results information to themselves. This information can be spread verbally, be it accidental or intentional without the consent of the tested patient. However, there are laws that protect genetically patients from genetic discrimination by society that have been imposed (Bombard, 2007). These laws have been implemented in the United States and many other countries (Bombard, 2007). Genetic discrimination can be reduced with the existing of these laws as legal actions can be taken against those who discriminate.

For example, there is a research to compare the cost of nuclear power and the cost of the most common power resource, coals.

This is because the carrier would have to follow up on their medical appointments and as a result, the efficiency and productivity of the company would be adversely affected. Furthermore, due to the need for regular health checkup, the carrier would not be allowed to purchase insurance as the insurance company would be footing the carrier's medical bills. However, these acts of genetic discrimination could be prevented by a law called the Privacy Rule, which is enforced by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in April 2003 (Norrgard, 2008).

According to Russell (Juto oppose8), the price of one unit is estimated to be US$12 billion. The operating costs after paying off building fees for around 12 years are still higher than those of solar and wind power by 4 cents per kilo-watt hours. Why would one choose to pay more for the same amount of energy used? It is because the new reactors could produce hydrogen as well which is an important source of fuel (Butler, 2004) but expensive to produce. Moreover, wind and solar power depend on inconsistent factors such as sunlight and wind respectively. Hence, nuclear power has the advantage in terms of higher output and consistent energy productihelpss it runs 90 per cent of the time (Kurt, 24 September 2008). With much more consistent energy production, factories and companies that rely on consistent energy to be productive would certainly choose performance over costs as disruptions might incur losses higher than paying for nuclear power.": 1858, "Firstly, the revelation of a known genetic risk to one's relatives allows them to prepare for constructive changes in their lives. One such change would be to make new decisions for family planning. Due to the lack of treatment strategies of some genetic disorders, a carrier might have a short lifespan. Therefore, it is both essential to plan for an early retirement or to start a family. A carrier could devise a financial plan so that one would have sufficient monetary resources to support oneself even after an early retirement. One main objection to starting a family is that the affected genes or chromosomes might be passed on to the children. This, however, can be prevented using an expensive technology, Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) such as pre-implantation of genetic diagnosis whereby \"only unaffected embryos are allowed to develop to term\" (Norrgard, 2008). Thus, a carrier could still start a family without passing the genetic disorder to the children. Furthermore, this could lead to another constructive change for the carrier's relatives. For relatives who are planning to have children, they must either be financially prepared for ART as well as the future medical bills, or choose not to have children. As for those who already have children, they must also be financially prepared. On top of that, they would have to choose the right time to convey to their children that they might be carriers of a certain genetic disorder. These changes and preparations cannot be achieved overnight, and therefore, revealing a known genetic risk to one's relatives is necessary.": 1859, "The new millennium brought about promising medical advancements that have positive impacts on human's lives. Remarkable breakthroughs, particularly in the field of genetics, allow humans to better understand the cause of diseases, so as to formulate cure or preventive drugs that can be tailored to individual idiosyncrasies. This is made possible through a series of genetic tests on an individual. Genetic testing is the detection of abnormalities in the human genomes, to indentify presence of genetic disorder and to assess the possible risk of developing genetic disorder in the future. Some examples of such genetic disorders include single gene defects, multifactorial problems and teratogenic problems (Weill Medical College of Cornell University 2003). Though the benefits of genetic testing are numerous, individuals are forced to face an ethical dilemma of whether they are obligated to reveal the results to their relatives. In my opinion, I believe that individuals should be obligated to reveal such information to their relatives.": 1971, "Another concern is that if a nuclear power plant has an entirely passive system, there is no or very limited opportunity to manage events or post the incident and perhaps operators will not be able to turn valves off remotely. Nonetheless, director of reactor systems of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. claimed that the design was robust and relying on gravity can possibly gain a ten-fold increase in safety than traditional pumps and valves (Mayson R., 2002). Moreover, the objective of passive safety systems is to completely eliminated core degradation in the design (A.K. Nayak, R.K. Sinha, 2007) which makes the reactions much reliable and back-up systems are set available to avoid totally reliance on only one kind of system. Thus, the danger coefficient is greatly reduced. Due to the fact that passive safety concept offers an opportunity to effect a large simplification (in the form of reduction of human intervention and external source of power), costs on the construction of nuclear power plants are cut down significantly. As in a virtuous circle, the saved capital can then be put into more research use and equipment maintenance. Therefore, safety is ensured step by step.": 493, "In conclusion, the revealing of genetic testing results may bring more problems than solutions to the individual and therefore they should be given the final say in whether to reveal the results. Many problems such as discrimination and psychological stigmatisation attributed from the release of genetic testing should be taken into consideration when deciding whether to reveal the genetic testing results as they can worsen an individual's health condition.": 1860, "The first nuclear reactor plant was built in Obninsk, a city in Russia, in 1954. Since then, the debate on whether we should use the nuclear energy has never been cooled down. Although nuclear energy was famous for its cleanness and abundance, the public was anxious about its safety. The catastrophic nuclear accidents such as Three Mile Island event and Chernobyl accident have cast a shadow over the safety of nuclear plants. However, can we draw a conclusion that nuclear energy is not the suitable energy that human beings can use? The answer is no. Since 2000, ten countries including US, UK, Canada, France, Brazil, Japan and so on have started to cooperate in the research on a future generation of nuclear energy system, known as Generation 4. After two years' great effort they have come up with a concrete and significant report about Generation 4 reactor concepts.

Current reactors will still be usable for a long time thus the construction cost will be spread over the years. New plants are easier to build and maintain, thus reducing construction cost.

When individuals chose to reveal such information chooseeir relatives, relatives will be able to undergo aggressive and constant monitoring of the colon growth which can prevent the disease into becoming fatal (Burt and Jasperson 2008). Such ealy prevention and cure to fatal diseases are only possible if relatives are notified beforehand, and that responsibility lies on the individual who underwent genetic testing. Such information will also allow family members and relatives to make more fully informed choices regarding their future, including decisions on marriage and career, as well as lifestyle habits. Thus individual of known genetic risk should be obligated to reveal test results to relatives because it brings awareness concerning the risk of inheriting the disease to the foreground, not only to the person tested, but for his or her relatives as well.": 1865, "Some of the genetic diseases could be cured if it is detected early.

The country is not only made up of the elderly. The majority of the population is still the young who are now sweating and toiling for the country just like what the aged had done in the past. Hence the government should also divert some of the resources to improve the lives of these people such as subsidies for birth-giving, which not only reduces the cost burden of having a child but also encourages people to have more children, thus increasing the replacement rate.

The decision to undergo genetic testing is actually a personal choice as it is influenced by factors such as family history and having the risk for a disorder.

It has also brought about some ethical and moral issues surrounding it. Some people state that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing. But actually, they have spoken too high of the human rationality. Here, I disagree with these people and want to assert that individual should not have the right to reveal the result.

According to the article Genetic testing is all in the family by Jeffery P. Kahn, Director of Centre for Bioethics, University of Minnesota, the family has the right to know the result of the genetic test of any member in the family. Since the whole family shares the same set of genes, the information the individual provides through the genetic testing may have just as much meaning for the family as for him or herself (Kahn, 2000). Therefore, these results should be told, no matter if it is good or bad. However, some may claim that the individuals have the right to protect their privacy (Kahn, 2000), and like other private information, genetic information should be protected properly, and people have the final say whether to reveal it to others. However, here there is something more important than privacy. Genetic disorder only can be treated if those carriers of a known genetic risk decide to reveal their genetic result. Moreover, we can only protect our children from inherited disease if we know whether there is a genetic risk. As a result, the carriers of a known genetic risk should tell their relatives.": 1878, "Secondly, if the individual requesting genetic testing does not have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing, the individual will have problems with his loved ones, such as stress within the family and strained family relationships (FamilyDoctor.org, 2005).

Even if the individual chooses to tell the family at a later timing for the benefit of not wanting to worry his loved ones, the family will on the other hand feel that it was irresponsible of the individual not to share his/her burden with the family, since the family had to find out the truth from another party.

Social subsidies should not be expanded simply because there is currently a budget surplus.,but the government budget is expected to be tight,and to focus subsidies": 1880, "Secondly, a carrier should inform his or her family as the family members have the ability to make an informed choice for their actions towards the problem.

Relatives can provide necessary help to the carriers by providing more care and concern.

Furthermore, revealing the results to the relatives can encourage them to be more health conscious and also to remind that to take go for frequent checkups since they might run the risk of having the same disorder too (Weiss 1999). However, this does not apply to all individuals and there is a possibility that they may even face discriminations from their own family members and relatives.

They worry that plutonium, which is the material used for producing nuclear weapons, can be stolen during reprocessing. In fact, this problem can be solved and prevented. In a molten salt reactor, plutonium is separated from nuclear waste and added back to the reactor as fuel. This indicates that the separated plutonium will not be discarded but can be well monitored. Besides, the amount of weapons-grade fission generated in the molten salt reactor is small (\"Generation IV nuclear reactor,\" 2009). Furthermore, scientists have been developing reprocessing technologies that maintain high proliferation resistance. Currently, there are technologies like Plutonium and Uranium Recovery by Extraction (PUREX), Uranium Extraction (UREX) and Mixed Oxide (MOX). The PUREX and the MOX both can handle the weapons-grade plutonium as the reactors-grade plutonium is hard to be stolen due to lethal radioactivity. The UREX can ensure relatively high proliferation resistance which results in high radioactivity (\"Nuclear reprocessing,\" 2005).

Consequently, consolation, support and solicitude of relatives are very important once the individuals are tested positive for genetic diseases.": 1918, "However, further investigations showed that these could be prevented at the initial stage which was at the design stage. In the journal written by Wilpert (2007), the use of psychology in the design process could help to prevent accidents from happening or at least minimize the damage from the accidents. It is currently encouraged to all design process especially in engineering design to have psychology knowledge involved.": 532, "Some of the measures that could be introduced and implemented to increase the safety aspects of future hybrid cars include using higher resistance tyres or tyres with more grooves. Currently, the tyres of hybrid cars are of low resistance to draft air resistance. This poses a danger especially on rainy days or on wet surfaces. A scientific and logical explanation was given by Serway,&Jewett (N.D), whom explained that on rainy days or on wet surfaces, static and kinetic friction would be reduced greatly. Static and kinetic friction depends greatly on its coefficient, which usually ranges from 0.5 to 1.5. However,on wet surfaces, the coefficient would be greatly reduced and vehicles would be more prone to skidding or swerving off-course. Hence, by using tyres of higher resistance, it will increase the friction between the tyres and road surfaces thus reducing chances of skidding or instability of vehicles. The inclusion of airbags into hybrid cars are also detrimental to the safety of its users. In the present market, the size of a hybrid car is small. Hence, they do not have airbags fitted inside the car. This poses danger to the driver as well as passengers because in the event of an accident, when the driver jammed down hard on the brakes, the effects of inertia will be very large. Thus, without the aid of an airbag, the driver and front passenger especially may just crashed straight through the windscreen and incurred serious injuries. But, with the aid of an airbag, these will be prevented as the effects of inertia which caused the driver and front passenger to crash straight through the windscreen will be cushioned by the airbags.": 533, "Secondly, the disclosure of individuals' genetic information to employers may result in employment discrimination. Competition in market forces and drive for economic efficiency can invoke employers to exploit the genetic information as opportunities to reduce cost and improve work efficiency. Employers would prefer to hire a \"healthy worker\" because they have a lower frequency of being absent through illness which translates to lower cost in work impairments, hiring temporary replacements and fewer precautions to be taken to deal with health and safety risks. Moreover, genetic information can also deny a person with late onset of the disease of a particular job, for example a person with Huntington's disease, being healthy most of his or her life time. Though some employers claimed that knowing individuals' genetic information can help them to take specific measures to protect individuals at risk of occupational diseases, it might not be feasible to the financial status of a company if such measures were to incur huge sums of money. The overriding truth is that employers would inevitably be more concerned about the company's profitability. In fact, disclosure of genetic information has no benefits to people at risk of non- occupational diseases, but serves to reduce their chances of employment. Moreover, there is currently no legal protection against genetic discrimination in most parts of the world. Therefore, individual should still hold the right and freedom to the final say because of possible employment discrimination as they have no legal protections.": 1919, "An aging population poses significant challenges and significant implications for Singapore. One of the challenges that need to be addressed will be the aging population on the economy. As reported, \"Singapore has one of the fastest aging populations in the world, with over 65-year-olds estimated by 2030 to represent 23% of the population, the second highest percentage in Asia lagging behind only Japan.\" (Wijaya, 2009) With the aging population occupying \u00bc of the population, public spending should not be limited on the aged. In view of the graying population, government expenditure on the aged is inevitable. Higher life expectancy of the population is foreseen with the literate population getting healthier together with the advancement in medical technology we have currently. Singapore's only and main resource is her population. Taking care of the aged forms a part of the nation's welfare expenditure. Long-term care and health costs are examples of the welfare expenditure. Limiting public spending on the aged should not be implemented in view of the small fraction spent on welfare. \"Social security and welfare payments to just 2.15 per cent of the total government expenditure.\" (Fernandez, 1994) More funding will be essential as demand for health care increases. Old age dependency is not a given. This means that the older population should continue to work if they are willing to. By extending the retirement age, this reduces the expenditure to provide for the aged. However, one has to bear in mind the sizeable segment of the population that needs the government to aid them. One has to take into the consideration the people who are living alone with no family and children for financial support. Unsound financial management and little education are also some aspects that may result in elderly dependency on the government. From research, it is reflected that 9% of the population in Singapore are not living with children or spouse. This means their financial and emotional support comes solely from government support. Public assistance is needed especially so for families who rely on voluntary organizations and self -help group. In Singapore context, large subsidies are given in three core areas. They are mainly health, education, and housing. Taking care of the population needs brings about the country's development. After all, the population itself is Singapore's core asset to progress. To date, these three areas are highly subsidized and funded. This is evident in \"three high-subsidy areas - housing, health and education amounted to $3.4 billion last year, or about one third of its total expenditure.\" (Fernandez, 1994) With a rapidly aging workforce, it is not feasible to reduce spending on the aged and divert them to other areas of the country's development. In a way, the other areas of development are seen with substantial amount spent. Thus, it will be unfair to limit the fiscal cost spent on the aged. Looking at a financial issue point of view, the government still makes it a point to promote self-reliance and individual savings within the nation. This is to ensure that the elderly will have enough and are ready for old age. An example of will be mandatory saving scheme: Central Provident Fund (CPF). With this practice, public spending on the aged should then be limited. In a way, with adequate personal savings the dependency on government aid is decreased. In conclusion, it is not wise to limit public spending on the age given the fact that reliance on the government support is necessary to certain group of the elderly. With longer life expectancy and declining birth rates, elderly dependency on the young should be shared across with the government. In the long run, the tax burden to support the aged may seem too demanding for the young workers. As a result this may affect the country's development when we take into consideration the welfare of the young working population. Financing issues of the nation should be carefully implemented in order to ensure a healthy economy status of the country. Singapore in this aspect has done a good job by providing the minimal yet sufficient welfare benefits to the population. In any part of a nation's economy, a well balanced of expenditure and earnings is sought upon. Hence limitation on public spending on the aged should not be implemented, given the fact that the aged makes up a quarter of the population.": 534, "Technology always evolves whatever human's interference is in the sense that every previous attempt of halting the development of technology in history proved futile.

In Chernobyl(2006), the writer points out that the reactors were designed and adapted for the production of plutonium for military businesses. This dual function could have compromised safety of the reactor. Psychology or the employment of psychologists to assist the design process would thus futile. However, this may not be the case. Psychology understands that almost every action has a causal history which leads up to the root of the problem. This concept is evident when accounts of the accident reviewed th the operator indifferently disregarded safety protocols. In fact, Stang(1996) notes that running the reactors at low operating standards was commonplace. Hence, designers could have could have brought in psychologists to evaluate the design to inhibit such unauthorized practices and to ecould perhapshe safety standards are kept high.

As we know, parents nowadays always worry about their children. However, living in the hustle and bustle of city life, many parents utilize their time to work harder to climb up the social ladder rather than supervise their kids' movements. Hence, RFID technology is indeed a good method to help the parents to keep an eye on their children's whereabouts. RFID tags are introduced to be sewn into children's attires or set in their wristband to track their positions and activities (Gautam, 2006). The importance of this surveillance technology is that it can make sure of the children's safety so that the parents can work at ease. Although most of the children today have mobile phones, it is also possible that their mobile phones are lost or they are having difficulties to pick up their phones such as kidnapping. If the children are being kidnapped, with the surveillance technology of RFID, the parents can track their locations.

Furthermore, the accident could have been prevented if designer had done it right at the beginning. As Wilpert (2007) suggested, psychology, in fact, could help the design process to consider on how human mistakes could be prevented or at least reduced.

Moreover, the introduction of this concept will produce electricity that is as cheap as those produced by coal and gas. However, the cost of building nuclear reactors has to be evaluated first before even starting to build them.(Foulke and Burnett,2005). It is expensive to build a new nuclear reactor, taking into consideration the area of land needed, the cost of buying the nuclear fuel for energy processing, the cost of the coolant and the cost of the construction materials. In the U.S, sixty-three billion dollars is needed to build a new reactor and the maintenance and the operating costs are not included in it(O'Reilly,2007). The money invested can be used to improve healthcare or even the harnessing of other forms of energy like solar energy to produce electricity.

Radioactivity is unwanted as it can remain active for hundreds of years if it is not properly contained. (David.s 2007) The second advantage is an enhanced nuclear weapons proliferation resistance. Due to the nature of a thorium based fuel cycle, essential elements for nuclear weapons like enriched uranium cannot be chemically separated from thorium. Unlike thorium, enriched uranium used in the VHTR and it can potentially produce a bomb. Moreover uranium is limited in supply and not as abundant as Thorium. The need for expensive fuel-enrichment facilities is unnecessary when Thorium is being used as the main fuel cycle too. Both MSR and VHTR are state-of-the-art nuclear reactors. Automation throughout the reactors and passive safety features are just some of the technology implemented to make the Generation IV reactors safer.

In order to sway nuclear-adverse public, the Generation IV concept's reactors need to yield less radioactive waste at terrorist-proof facilities. In term of security, reactors that do not reprocess nuclear waste are favored as plutonium waste, a key ingredient for developing advanced nuclear weapon, will not be generated. To abstain nuclear proliferation, the other four reactors were eliminated, left with only two designs - very high temperature reactor (VHTR) and supercritical-water reactor (SCWR), which would able to operate without having to reprocess and recycle plutonium waste.

However, the income will not be useful to the locals as it will not be directed to them. Developing countries should provide long term and stable jobs for their people. In this case, alternate source of energy like solar energy could be considered as the price of solar panels are on a decline (Solarbuzz, 2009) instead of spending billions of dollars building Generation IV reactors. Solar energy is also environmental friendly like nuclear power and is free with the sunlight predicted to continue to radiate energy for another 5 billion years (Arnett, 2009). This will be a good solution as it provides stable job and also ensuring that energy is aplenty for a long time. As the maintenance of a solar energy plant requires many low knowledge based technician, this will help to create long term jobs for the locals. This in turn will help to ease the problem of poverty and unemployment in developing countries. Developing countries should solve the problem of high unemployment rate and poverty within the country as priority rather than to build a generation IV reactor. The initial cost of building a generation IV nuclear reactor is a multi billion dollars project. Furthermore, the Generation IV reactors are still in the research stage (Bulter, 2004) which suggested that there are still plenty of questions and uncertainty that link to the safe operation before it can be consider complete. Therefore, funding should be directed to other energy source like solar power where solar energy are environmental friendly and free (Energy Information Administration, n.d).

Singapore government had been aware of the potential problems with regard to ageing society since the 1980s (Mehta). Various committees, like Committee on the Problems of the Aged and the National Council on Family and Aged (NACFA), were formed over the years to address the challenges of an ageing population. In the recent years two more high-level committees, Committee on Ageing Issues (CAI) and Ministerial Committee on Aging (MCA), were formed to spearhead the vision of successful ageing in Singapore (MCYS, 2008). In order to tackle these problems, policies were designed and implemented in different stages. I agree to a large extent that the current policies have helped to ease the aging process. Therefore in terms of researching, I will be focusing on public policies aspect of the ageing population. The committees built on works of previous committees with believe that policies should allow the elderly to benefit in terms of housing, employability and financial security, healthcare and eldercare and active aging (MCYS, 2006). In terms of housing, studio apartments (SA) are built with elderly friendly features like non-slip tiles, smoke detectors and emergency alarms. These housings are specially catered for the elder, especially singles or poor elderly, to provide them with a range of housing options depending on their ideal living arrangement. Furthermore, buyers are allowed to utilize their Central Provident Fund (CPF) to purchase home at an affordable subsidised price (MCYS, 2006) Moreover, family members of the elderly benefit from schemes like Married Child Priority, when they choose to accommodate with or near their parents. Thus, by creating these housings, jobs are created for the construction and development industry to build these housings. This will help to boost up the economy to ease the aging process. Policies for employability and financial security like the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme for the older low-wage workers were introduced in 2007. Under the WIS scheme, elderly are given supplements apart from the CPF contributions made in their by employer. These policies will increase the older workers chances of continuing their employability, due to the reduction of employer's CPF contribution rate and build up their retirement savings (MCYS, 2008). With more people in the workforce, productivity will increase, which will at the same time enhance the economy. Eldershield Scheme was improved in 2007 to make step-down care services affordable to the elderly in particular the low wage elders (MCYS, 2008). With this scheme, elderly are able to afford the services which are specially created for them. Daycares centres and day rehabilitation centres allow the children of the seniors to work productively knowing that their parents are in good care. Furthermore elderly can interact with other people at these centres, thus they will not feel lonely. Therefore, there is a holistic approach towards the healthcare and eldercare of the elderly, which goes with the committee's vision.

First, they say that the generation IV actors are very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR), which react in both high temperature and pressure. It is very dangerous because nuclear reactors are very likely to explode under the condition of high temperature and pressure. Second, the key element of the nuclear power Plutonium is a radioactive metal element, which would release large number of radiation in decay and reactions. The radiation would do harm to human health in the long-term study. Whereas, to the problem of high temperature and pressure, scientist put forward some corresponding improvements in generation IV reactors. First, we take fluoride salts as the coolant for molten salts reactors in the reactions. The fluoride salts are \"thermodynamically stable (i.e., they do not decompose upon heating)\" and have the good effect of cooling CITATION WFo07 \\l 2052 (W.Forsberh, Peterson, & Zhao, 2007). Moreover, comparing with other generation IV reactors like Gas-cooled fast reactors and Supercritical-water-cooled reactors, the pressure for molten salts reactors is low. Furthermore, the molten salts reaction facilities are made of thick reinforced concrete. Reinforced concrete has the characteristics of firmness and anti high temperature. This kind of material can absorb radiation produced by the plutonium, so that the radiation will be greatly reduced.

These substances may reflect the radio waves which make the information hard to read. The RFID tags also have to be placed in proper positions, taking into account its angles and alignment in order to obtain a proper reading. This can be quite a hassle and it requires a lot of concentration. However, RFID tags are usually placed in an area with optimum frequency which enables the RFID readers to obtain the information contained in the tags correctly. Active RFID tags which are tags that use batteries to increase the range of frequency of a system can be used to solve this problem.

In addition, desirability of sharing information with family members is also emphasized through counseling and doctor's persuading, but not made a condition as it does not supersede the individual's right to privacy. Furthermore, it is false that family members are not protected, because the court passes on laws to reveal an individuals' genetic information.

Therefore, it is justified for the carriers to buy insurance so that they can get a sufficient amount of coverage as compensation for any mishap that may or may not happen. Raising premium for such individuals is seen as taking advantage of them.

In the past the reason why the nuclear accidents usually were very serious was that the fuel had the tendency to heat up automatically. So a small inducement can cause huge disaster. As VHTR has this important feature, disastrous event can be efficiently avoided and the prevention does not depend on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operators any more. Furthermore, VHTR has a goal to essentially eliminate the need for offsite emergency response. The strategy for meeting this goal is to identify severe accidents that lead to offsite radioactive releases (New clear agency, 2002).

Individuals with Huntington's disease develop their symptoms such as uncontrolled movements and mental declination only at an average age of 35-44 years old. Knowing that the employee could not remain committed to the company in the next 5-10 years, the employer decides to retrench that employee. As such, the employee's potential will be hindered as he or she would still be able to work normally until the symptoms set in 5-10 years from now.

Otto (2007) notes that many employers have obliged people to take genetic testing first before they are hired. Some argue that a genetic elimination in choosing worker is discrimination because this is an action of limiting one's right to work (Andre and Velasquez 2009). However, the genetic testing is to ensure the safety of all workers. The worker who has genes disease can be not ne hired but this for the life of people around him.": 2080, "One of these opposing points is about its highly-required condition. High temperature (510--550) and very high pressure (about 25 MPa) is required for SCWR. This condition requires high-quality materials, and consequently, much money would be spent on research to find these materials. Nevertheless, there indeed exist some advanced materials that can satisfy these requirements. And many new successful studies are going on. One of the ideal materials is the alloy MA956. It has excellent oxidation resistance up to 1370(2400) and significant creep strength up to its usually high melting point of 1482(2700). Thicker sections may be used up to 1370(2500). Corrosion-resistance is excellent for this material. Therefore, material is no longer a problem. Furthermore, SCWR is promised to supply low-cost electricity, and simpler design can minimize the cost, too. Thus it is acceptable and worthwhile spending some money on the further material research.": 2081, "Firstly, it is important to reveal the result if a couple is planning to get married and one of them has any inheritable diseases. This is because they have high possibilities of passing on mutated gene to their children. Even though some are healthy carriers and not affected by the diseases fully because of the single copy of the dominant genotype, they have 50% chance of passing the recessive gene to their generation. If a person did not disclose the result, a child with genetic disabilities may born and then lead to problems in the family. For example, the partner may feel betrayed and end the relationship for concealing the truth. Here the family relation will be affected and who is going to share responsibility of taking care of the poor child? The child will be left out and will be in an unpleasant atmosphere. On the other hand, if the partner knows about this person's genetic condition earlier, they will plan well before getting married since they are in love and care about each other. They may opt to adopt a child rather than giving birth to a genetically impaired child. Hence, it is advisable to disclose the genetic testing result in order to prevent risks of diseases to future generation.": 2082, "The main misconception about nuclear energy is its radiation and its possibility to explode once it is under attack. In fact, the nuclear reactor doesn't produce the weapon grade reaction. Hence, it won't explode even when it is under attack. Moreover, the structure of the nuclear reactor is designed to be able to sustain high collision and prevent radiation. Hence, even it is under attack, the radiation will not leak. In the history, only two accidents occurred, the Three Mile Island and Chenobyl incident. The former did not cause any leakage and was well under control. The latter caused explosion and the radiation is still affecting people until now. However, we need to know that the latter incident happened at the generation I nuclear reactor, and it didn't follow the safety regulation then, hence causing the accident. Since then, the WNA has imposed strict regulations and most of the reactors in operation now are generation II and III reactors which are safer and more efficient. It is highly notable that since Chenobyl incident there has been no more accident. This shows that the nuclear reactors now are reliable. According to WNA, the current safety standard for nuclear reactors is 1 in 10000 core damage, which means that the core will possibly damage once in 10000 operation years. The United States reactors now have the safety standard of 1 in 100000, much better than required. In fact, in comparison with other energy sources, nuclear energy has the lowest fatality, as shown on the figure below: Source: Applied Energy 75 (2003) 7986": 2083, "Large and long-term healthcare expenses can substantially drain the resources of many of the elderly, especially for those without any savings for their retirement. This may include those with serious health problems, who are often unemployed or unfit to work. Therefore, these people usually do not have any incomes. In fact, some of them might even be receiving financial aids from the government. In addition, older people also tend to have longer unemployment, especially during a recession experienced nowadays. Firms actually prefer to employ the young who are more productive. For example in New York, workers ages 45 and over actually form a disproportionate share of the hard-luck recession category, the long-term unemployed (Michael, L., 2009). The financial problem faced by these unemployed is also worsened by the high cost of living in such developed countries. For example, in Singapore, the high cost of living is actually caused by the spending of the people on necessities like financial products and transportation (Tan K. L. 2008). Hence, with such high costs of living, the incomes of these elderly are just enough to feed themselves. Saving seems to be an impossible mission for them. Therefore, public pensions and government incentives will be a vital source of money to support these elderly that are among those without savings. It is important for the society to show its appreciation for the contribution made by the elderly. A Chinese saying goes like this, \"As human beings, we should not forget the past because without the past, we will not have what we have in the present.\" The elderly, in their younger days, have made many important contributions to the society. As pioneers who had arrived in a relatively unknown Singapore, the elderly had toiled and contributed largely to its success today.

The world seems to get relieved from the lack of energy source since the Generation IV reactors come out. However, the newborn technology, Generation IV reactors needs to be improved before it can be applied to practical uses. It is difficult to make a decision on whether there should be R&D funding for the development of Generation IV reactors. Although there are many benefits we can gain from Generation IV reactors, we still have to face the high cost, the danger for nuclear weapons and the difficulty in preventing corrosion of nuclear metallic materials. In my opinion, there should not be R&D funding for the development of Generation IV reactors.": 626, "Nuclear weapon and terrorism are always sensitive topics to both government and ordinary people. Because the waste of the nuclear reactor can be used by terrorists to produce nuclear weapons, many people doubt whether it can provide true safety if scientists can only prommade the reactor is safe during the operation.

That is to say \"the new processing technologies will enable the fuel to be recycled without sCadarache, the plutonium (World Nuclear Association, 2008)\". In this case, the waste will all be recycled in the reactor and terrorists will not get ahad madeance to reach the nuclear raw materials.

They say that the non-recyclable radioactive waste in the VHTR reactor can harm the environment and people's health. Although the waste of nuclear reactors is indeed radioactive, the VHTR reactor design minimises the possibility for radioactive elements to harm the environment. According to research, the radioactivity for the VHTR waste is relatively small compared with the other reactors. VHTR produces \"less heavy metal radioactive waste\" and \"less plutonium per unit of energy produced\" because of VHTR's high thermal efficiency (Shropshire and Herring, 2004).It has a high thermal efficiency of over 50%, while other reactors only have a thermal efficiency of 33%-50% (U.S. DOE Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee, 2009).Thus, VHTR is less harmful to the environment.": 2108, "The transportation sector alone will cause the demand of oil and fuel up by 78% at the year of 2025 (Butler, 2004). Therefore, we cannot solely depend on our fossil fuels for this problem. There are alternative source of fuel in the market nowadays. The most popular one is Fuel cell which is made from hydrogen. Some technologies like Supercritical and Sodium-water-cooled reactors are unable to produce hydrogen. On the other hand, VHTR technology has both electricity and hydrogen output. While electricity can be used to power up houses, hydrogen can be converted into fuel cells which can power up automobiles and vehicles. Fuel cells have theoretical efficiency of 80% compared to diesel which is only about 40% (Crea, 2004). Therefore, we can be rest-assured that future nuclear reactors like VHTR can meet the industrial demands and thus its research should be funded.": 643, "In conclusion, the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to reveal the results to one's relatives could assist them in adapting to changes in their lives and allow researchers to find a cure for a particular genetic disorder.

More recently, environmental concerns and rising energy demands are putting nuclear power back into the energy equation. However, if nuclear power is to win the approval of the previously disapproving public, it will have to be more cost-effective, environmentally-friendly and almost void of security concerns. Keeping this in mind the pioneer nations of nuclear power have come up with a few generation-IV reactor concepts (Butler, 2004). The earliest concept that is going to be introduced is the Sodium- Cooled fast reactor concept, which requires relatively new low pressure and temperature to operate and recycles its nuclear waste. Examining the public's concerns with respect to the Sodium-Cooled fast reactor will give us a useful insight on the potential of nuclear power.

Compared to the old generation reactors which use light water as coolant, the molten salt cooled reactor operates at low pressure which prevents explosion caused by steam. Due to the low pressure, a high-pressure steel vessel is not necessary for a molten salt reactor (\"Molten salt reactor,\" 2009). This makes the reactor smaller and lighter so that plant controlling and emergency handling will be easy. In addition, the inert property of fluoride salts and the liquid reacting environment further prevent core explosion (Gat and Dodds, 2006). For radioactivity leakage, it is unlikely to happen in a molten salt reactor as the salts will freeze to prevent dispersal (Gat and Dodds, 2006).

Psychology understands that almost every action has a causal history which leads up to the root of the problem.

In fact, the nuclear reactor doesn't produce the weapon grade reaction. Hence, it won't explode even when it is under attack. Moreover, the structure of the nuclear reactor is designed to be able to sustain high collision and prevent radiation. Hence, even it is under attack, the radiation will not leak. In the history, there were only two accidents occurred, the Three Mile Island and Chenobyl incident. The former did not cause any leakage and was well under control. The latter caused explosion and the radiation is still affecting people until now. However, we need to know that the latter incident happened at the generation I nuclear reactor, and it didn't follow the safety regulation then, hence caused the accident. Since then, the WNA has imposed strict regulations and most of the reactors in operation now are generation II and III reactors which are safer and more efficient. It is highly notable that since Chenobyl incident there is no more any accident. This shows that the nuclear reactors now are reliable. According to WNA, the current safety standard for nuclear reactor is 1 in 10000 core damage, which means that the core will possibly damage once in 10000 operation years. The United States reactors now have the safety standard of 1 in 100000, much better than requirement.

The Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) is one of the most popular generation IV concepts of nuclear power. Like the old nuclear reactors, the promotion of SWCR is opposed by some people because of security, environment, performance and cost issues. However, with its unique advantages and the global demand of energy, it is reasonable and to some extent necessary to support further research funding of SWCR. With the great destructions done by the explosion of some previous reactors, some people still oppose SWCR for concerning of security and environmental issues. It is still remember that in 1979 at Three Mile Island, the reactor exploded and killed 31 at once and spewed radioactive across Europe. But SWCR is much safer and reliable compared with the old reactors. It would include simplified safety features that do not rely on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operatorsall are, in principle, 'melt down proof' of an accident with minimal, if any, human intervention (Butler, D. 2004). This suggests that any attempt to trigger an accident deliberately by simply switching off the coolant or power supply would be in vain. Besides, it generates little waste and some of them can be recycled. Actually it is much cleaner than many other forms of energy that emits too much green-house gas and various pollutions. Some opponents may question the performance of SWCR. They doubt that whether or not it is more efficient than other old reactors. For this question, SWCR gives us a satisfactory answer. The SWCR system is built on two technologies: Light Water Reactors and supercritical fossil-fired boilers. It uses extremely high pressure to prevent water from boiling at temperature up to 500.Thus the thermal efficiency is greatly improved, about 45% versus about 33% efficiency for current Light Water Reactors (Idaho National Laboratory: Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor). Although nuclear energy is an effective energy form, it is quite demanding in terms of technology and the cost may be not acceptable. Some people may question whether SWCR is good enough to be applied widely, especially in developing countries. Actually SWCR is simple to design and built that largely lower its cost. This is because it has a fast neutron spectrum to generate more power for the same size of reactor and it resembles traditional LWR fuel. Hence Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor is applicable for more countries.

Naturally, The public would have an impression that VHTR would be much more expensive, comparatively to renewable energy such as solar and wind. However, this is not the case. VHTR will be cheaper as cost incurred on transportation of nuclear waste is redundant. This is because the nuclear waste goes directly to a respiratory which is located within the nuclear plant (Clayton 2009). Furthermore, VHTR produces cheaper energy compared to solar and wind energy. Barry (2009) cites that the capital cost of building a solar plant is 25 times more than nuclear plant and the land area solar plant occupies is 400 times more than nuclear plant.

Nuclear power, a breakthrough discovery that was celebrated at the end of nineteenth century, is ironically feared as a tool of destruction today. Acting like a double edged sword, scientists hailed it as the wonder that can solve current energy crisis while critics believed incidents such as 1986 Chernobyl accidents in Ukraine and 1976 Three Mile Islands reactors meltdown may occur again. However, due to worldwide soaring increase in carbon emission, a series of new generation IV nuclear generators concepts were proposed.

For instance, Sweden is moving out of the nuclear power industry within the next 10 years. Sweden is even committed by law to phase out its existing nuclear power plants (Fred Guterl, 2002). This indicates that nuclearlic support has declined in the recent years. One of the main reasons of the decline is due to the fact that the nuclear power plant might cause dangerous consequences when it mnuclearions, due to its unstable nature. Secondly, the amount of radioactive waste emittednatural uranium power plant is also harmful to the earth, and yet, these nuclear plants release large amounts of highly rhundredsive compound. Thirdly, the challenge faced by the countries to isolate the leftover, highly radioactive material discharged by the nuclear power plant is also a main reason why it is in decline. The wastes produced are required to be isolated from humans and the environment for about 100,000 years before it is deemed safe and harmless to humans.": 2145, "Secondly, the importance or urge to use surveillance technology to track people is subtle.

Although the implanted chips can aid in storing valuable medical information that could prevent any misfortune or mistreatments to the patients, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns of risks like rejection or adverse tissue reaction with any RFID implants (CASPIAN Special Report, 2004). Not everyone is able to get an implant without side effects because each person's immunity system differs from one another. In addition, patients might suffer severe burns. There's a possibility that the implanted transponder will migrate and travel in the body, causing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) incongruence and electromagnetic interference. An MRI machine utilizes strong magnetic fields along with pulsed radio frequency fields that may induce electrical currents in conductive metal implants such as the RFID tags (CASPIAN Special Report, 2004). Presumably, MRI incompatibility with the tags means that patients possessing RFID implants are unable to undergo this potentially life-saving diagnostic procedure, unless they conduct a surgery and have the tag removed beforehand.": 1271, "Second, the reason someone should not disclose his testing result is concerning the psychological impact on the person and his family (Anonymous 1993). Some people may become depressed after knowing the result. Therefore, they need to tell the result to their closest people especially their family, thus, their family can comfort him and help him find ways to cure the disease. Even though some say that by revealing the result, one's family will also get depressed and this will affect the whole family. Nevertheless, if one discloses it by himself for a long time, he will get more and more depressed which will then ruin his life.

There is also a legal requirement, the privacy rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 that the health care providers have to respect and protect patients' privacy of health information (Agatha & Angst 2009). However, this legal requirement is decided on a case-to- case basis as there are situations that a clinician may consider necessary intervention; that is, notifying their family members for some life- threatening cases. For example, individuals with mutations that predispose them to malignant hyperthermia may die if they were under the use of certain surgical anaesthesia (Agatha & Angst 2009). Hence, it is important to notify relatives to let them know the risk and they could seek early treatment to prevent the risk and danger.": 2148, "Critics argue that genetic testing result is not fully accurate and by informing relatives regarding the result, it will impose unnecessary psychological burden to the family. This may result in family members responding negatively to the news and thus, straining the ties between the tested individual and his or her family members.

Research conducted by Angela Bradbury, an oncologist at Chase Fox, has shown that such worries are uncalled for (Newstaff, 2009). Only a small portion of the respondents have reported to receive negative responses from their family members. Many have given feedback that their relatives have handled the news well and have taken a pragmatic approach to the situation. Counseling will also be provided by physicians not only to the individual but also his or her family members (Stoffel et al., 2008). This will make it easier for family members to come to term with the situation and to handle it appropriately.

In fact, the VHTR could even produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel compared with other nuclear plants. In addition, the maintenance and labor cost of VHTR is much less than the coal plants. With the low maintenance fees, low labor cost and the high output of electricity, the total cost of the VHTR is actually less than the coal plants after a few years of operation.": 2151, "Firstly, individuals might not be ready to disclose their genetic testing results to their family members as they feel that their privacy is invaded (A.M, 2009). They are still not mentally prepared to disclose the information as they think that they might get discriminated by their relatives. For example, a person who has a risk of getting an inherited disease might not be able to inherit his family business for fear that he will not be able to withstand the tough job requirements. Hence, if they are not mentally and emotionally prepared to disclose such information, they should be given the right of not telling their relatives about it. However, critics argue that there are counseling sessions set up to help individuals understand their personal risk or the risk for other family members (Adams, 2003). Seeking third parties' opinion is not very useful as they might not fully understand the situation that individuals are in and often, they make wrong judgments.

When individuals chose to reveal such information to their relatives, relatives will be able to undergo aggressive and constant monitoring of the colon growth which can prevent the disease into becoming fatal (Burt and Jasperson 2008). Such early prevention and cure to fatal diseases are only possible if relatives are notified beforehand, and that responsibility lies on the individual who underwent genetic testing. Such information will also allow family members and relatives to make more fully informed choices regarding their future, including decisions on marriage and career, as well as lifestyle habits.

There have been numerous improvements in construction methods in the last few decades and that is fully applicable to the construction of a nuclear power plant. However some methods required early investment to secure the longevity and security of the plant in the long term.

Most nuclear plants have longer lifespan of more than 40 years according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Hence, if the plants can still perform well, it gets extra 20 years extension once 40-year plant licenses expired. Therefore, these will lead to the high energy outputs which can cater for an increasing demand on the electricity consumption.

This goes to show that how great the potential of nuclear power. Although there are some disadvantages present and the time for the earliest delivery of Generation IV still has years to go, they are just minority problems. In order to cater for more electricity consumption in the future, there is a need to look for another source of energy, \"Nuclear Power\". With this in mind, more researches and development have to be carried out especially for VHTR system which has been described as a prototype for next generation nuclear plants [4]. Therefore, I do agree with nuclear power is a new dawn for the next generation and the main focal point for research and development (R&D) should be focusing on VHTR.

All these will lead to huge cost overrun for building a plant. Moreover, after three year of use, the long-lived toxic radioactive wastes are produced and accumulated. These radioactive materials cannot be burned compared to conventional reactors. Instead, these materials are stored near the nuclear plant until it is moved to a permanent facility.

Among all these six generation IV nuclear reactor plants, I think Very-high-temperature reactor is the most promising one. We can use this kind of reactors to solve our energy problems. Security has always been the most concerned problem which is also biggest trouble in using nuclear power. For the last few years, very few new nuclear power plants were built. We are not only concerning the shortage of technology but also considering the danger of terrorists. Nuclear power could be easily used as weapon because we do not need to consider controlling the bomb, but if we use nuclear power as energy, then we should make it safe for us to operate it.

It is understood that individuals who carry the disease do not wish to reveal his or her genetic results due to privacy issues or fear that their family members are not ready to accept it. However, by not sharing the information, they are posing a danger to their family members potentially at risk of carrying the disease. For example, strenuous exercise can cause sudden death in people with genetic diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Agatha &Angst 2009). It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait therefore it is high possibility that if an individual tested positive, his or her siblings would has one in two chance of carrying the same genetic mutation. Thus, it is obligate to notify relatives so that early recognition and treatment of the disease, if present, can be done.": 2209, "In order to make full use of the advantages of nuclear energy, the primary task for engineers is to improve its safety. Every time before we try to improve, we should first find out what has gone wrong. So let us take Chernobyl as an example, and have an insight of this nuclear industrial accident. About that disaster, some later investigations showed the design of the nuclear reactor had defects and someone insisted that the causes were all about technical problems. However, it is proved to be one-sided now. Actually if there were only the design defects, the final explosion was completely avoidable. Most of the investigators have come to a consensus that the primary cause for the Chernobyl is the failure of human management. Because of the staff's breach of duty, the operators detected the reactors' problem very late and even took erroneous actions. What's worse, the makeup of the working team was not adequate, for they didn't have a timely backup system. As a consequence, the emergency shut-down mechanism totally failed. All these small human errors came together and finally led to the Chernobyl explosion. For the sake of avoiding the failure of human factors, some engineers and sociologists bring up the idea of applying psychological methods to engineering design process, which is really necessary and effective in my opinion.": 2210, "Very few nuclear reactors have been built in the past few decades as the general public is extremely concern about its safe operation, especially after the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl which sent fear and created negative opinions on nuclear power among the public. Despite the two major accidents, nuclear power is actually very safe. Although 56 deaths had resulted from the Chernobyl accident, it is pale in comparison to the 5000 deaths annually due to coal mining activities (Moore, 2006). In fact, the Three Mile Island incident was a success story where radiation was contained safely within the containment vessel.": 708, "Opponents think reliability of passive safety systems are not that well understood compared with active safety systems. However, this opinion should not be counted as a ground to refuse to apply these passive systems in nuclear power plants. Active ones are widely understood and accepted because they have been used long enough to be observed and tested on. Meanwhile their shortcomings are also exposed gradually in application to nuclear power plants. That is why experts work more on substitutions, such as passive safeteliminateand a combination of both. The design procedure of the new ones also experienced large amounts of trials and errors and they are more advanced than the previous ones. When faced with doubts, passive safety systems will prove their reliability in the long run.a passive": 2211, "Secondly, by divulging one's genetic risk to one's relatives, the chances of researchers finding a cure for that risk would be higher. As genetic disorders only happen to a minority, there would not be many encounters and so the chances of a researcher being able to inquire into these disorders would be considerably low. This was further lowered by opponents who are against the revelation of genetic results due to intrusion of privacy. However, it did not occur to them that the revelation of results could increase the chances of medical researchers finding a remedy to the disorders. Moreover, there would be a possibility that a known genetic risk could be brought to an end and subsequent generations would not have to suffer. Therefore, only when one tells a known genetic risk to one's relatives, would there be aan individual'smedical researchers to find a cure for it, and eventually saving many lives from genetic disorders.peace of mind": 2212, "Businessballs.com.

There are however, variety of issue raised associated with the appropriateness to deploy RFID technology to track individuals. This is primarily due to the fear of privacy invasion, dehumanization, and the social impact of mass surveillance after putting such technology in place. Nonetheless, despite RFID is still progressing in its infancy stage, it is seen to possess uncapped potential and can be put into valuable uses, especially in connection with hospital- patient identification, anti-theft tracking as well as in government agencies for identification purpose.": 2214, "Secondly, when family members are informed, they would benefit from this information. Being aware that they are at high-risk, they might research and find out the possible problems and solutions. Thus, they would be able to make sound decision with this new knowledge.

However, if public spending is not limited, the increased expenditure on the elderly will be at the cost of the country's development.

Some accidents of nuclear power plants, such as the Chernobyl disaster occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, caused huge panic about the new clear power plant. However, during that time the nuclear reactors were not well developed. Researches done by the experts in United State showed that the security of the very high temperature would be improved quite a lot. First, since the core is composed of helium, whose coolant is dingle phase, and graphite whose thermal inertia is very large, the core becomes very steady and safe. In addition, fuel of the very high temperature reactor is designed to cycle from ore extraction of final waste disposal and radioactive wastes will be sent to repositories for final geologic disposal which will reduce both the lifetime and toxicity of the radioactive waste. Therefore, the safety of the very high temperature reactor is improved a lot.": 2218, "In summary, nuclear power is reliable, green and affordable.

However, nowadays the scientists have proved that with measured cautions, nuclear power could be used to supply alternated energy to the world as the fossil fuels would come to an end soon. At the same times, there are many evidences show that nuclear power could be considered as the best suggestion to mitigate global warming. This era is 'Nuclear Renaissance', and the reasons for the renaissance of nuclear are due to the advanced technology and innovation of human to make nuclear power safer, cleaner with better cost effectiveness.

Six concepts are put forward. William Magwood (2004), chairman of GIF's board, predicts that no more than three of these six concepts will become research prototypes and be put into practice. In my point of view, among all the six reactors, the Sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) is the one should be chosen as one of the prototypes. The generation IV SFR is a new concept which is safe not only when it operates for electric producing, but also when it meets the problem of nuclear weapons and the terrorism attack.

Upon applying of brakes, the kinetic energy which would otherwise be converted into heat energy due to the presence of friction will be converted into electricity instead and stored in the batteries.

Furthermore, according to the recent energy outlook, energy demands in the United States are expected to grow by 0.5% per year (EIA 2009). Governments are well aware of this and have been looking at alternative sources of energy such as solar, wind and particularly, nuclear energy. However, nuclear power plants pose a danger to the surrounding as a these reactorst of terrorists and in the event of a nuclear accident.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that more than 40 percent of the greenhouse gases produced would be attributed to the burning of fossil fuels by 2020 (Sullivan, 2008). However, using the generation IV nuclear reactors would reduce the emission of greenhouse gases as a method known as nuclear fission is applied to tap energy. The energy after the uranium is burnt in the fission process is used to vaporize water to produce steam which is then used to turn turbine to produce electricity (Gache, 2007). Moreover, if power from six nuclear reactors is used in Australia instead of fossil fuels, the greenhouse emission in Australia alone would be reduced by 4%. Hence, further research and funding are necessary for generation IV concepts as they help reduce the effect of global warming. However, opponents backtrack to the accidents on Chernobyl and the three-mile island and argue that funding should not be given for generation IV reactors. However, the accidents happened in the past. Furthermore, the new generation IV reactors are more safe and also help combat future climate changes. The generation IV reactors are not only safe to operate as they are machine operated, but they also reduce greenhouse gases that the current energy sources produce.": 2244, "RFID also known as radio frequency identification is a piece of technology, which makes use of electromagnetic or electrostatic waves in the radio frequency so as to identify or pass the information through the radio wave.

These situations will only make the carrier unhappier and hence choosing not to tell his or her relatives about the result. However, the situations mentioned above happen rarely within the family. Most of the discriminations are by the employers or the insurance companies. This is proven by another survey which has stated that 550 people had been denied employment or insurance, not by family member, due to their genetic defect (Genetic Information and the Workplace, 1998). Hence by telling relatives about the result will not face discrimination. It is only when the public get to know about it then will you face discrimination.

The generating cost should not be too high but competitive as compared with other energy source. On the other hands, the capital investment cost should be sufficiently low for developing nuclear system. Some critics that VHTR's building cost are relatively expensive as compared to SCWR. This is because the design of the cycle for SCWR is pretty simplistic as it does not require the use of jet pumps, pressurizes or dryers. One of the greatest aspects about SCWR is the implausible small size of reactor itself, as compared as other reactors of Generation IV. Nevertheless, some countries such as the United State and France prefers the VHTR rather the SCWR. In spite of the fact that cost of building for VHTR is relatively higher, two products are generated for the price of one.

In their point of view, psychology is not the deciding factor of the design process, and it is certainly not only the design process that contributes to the accident.

To ensure healthy state of individuals with ICC, proper cares, specifically avoidance of triggering events in daily routine, should be delivered by kinfolks (Burton, H., Alberg, C., Stewart, A., 2009).": 2430, "All in all, individuals have the rights to conceal their genetic test results in order to protect own privacy. Federal Privacy Commissioner, Crompton (2002, para. 3) pointed out that \"the right balance\" between willingness of patients and concerns of their relatives has to be taken into consideration as disclosure of health information is rather thorny. In addition to the importance of sharing genetic test results to reduce disease risk and practise family planning, support but not discrimination by family is the foremost form of assistance to those are tested positive for genetic diseases during their illness. Hence, individuals who carry genetic diseases are obligated to disclose their test results among their relatives.": 746, "In fact, the aging populations who do not have families or disabilities really need the helps from others. When they are sick, because of they do not have families or their disabilities, they cannot take care of themselves. Thus, the welfare programs will be the vital for them. But this does not mean that the public should spend much to help them. One of the reasons is those who without families and disabilities are just minority, the majority of the elderly have their own families and they will take care of their elderly. Furthermore, because of Singapore is a country which influenced by the Confucius thinking and emphasized on the filial piety, the young generation know their obligation to take care of the elderly. Thus, limit the public spending on the aging population and divert the money into other areas of the development of country will be a suitable and accessible proposal.": 2275, "Furthermore, helium is used as the coolant in the VHTR system. Not only is it advantageous to sodium because it can be subjected to high temperature, it is also efficient in transfer of thermal energy. Helium will not become radioactive and will not react with osafeguardials. Therefore in my opinion, VHTR is rated better only in terms of physical protection and performance as compared to SFR.employsthem": 2276, "The word 'Surveillance' originally came from France where it means 'to watch over' in French. Surveillance technology has a history dated back as early as 1965, where the first closed circuit television (CCTV) was used in the police force in the United States in public places (Roberts, 2005). The definition of surveillance technology is the ongoing monitoring of people or information to detect changes in trends or distribution to initiate investigative or control measures (The Joint Comission, 2006). The two most common and effective types of survan individuallance today is the global positioning system (GPS) and the radio frequency identification (RFID). The benefits of surveillance technology conspicuously outweigh the concerns about human privacy issues that are so often brought up by human rights bodies and the law (Michael & Rose, 2007). This is because thithe taxpayersent technology aids in crime prevention, social control and threat monitoring.": 2277, "However, this is not true and in fact, robotic surgery has a relative low risk level than conventional surgery. As mentioned before, robotic surgery is more precise and causes smaller incision. For example, according to Livingston (New York Health News, 2009), the all-robotic kidney transplant surgery is easier and less painful with its tiny robot incision and the patient is able to be back to normal activities within few weeks. Furthermore, to avoid the risk, the professional engineers are required to check and maintain the system before and after every surgery to ensure the functionality of robot. Surgeons are also well trained before they actually use the robot in performing the surgery. The robot is designed in the way that in case of emergency, it will stop operating immediately and the surgeon will take over the surgery himself. In this way, the safety of the patients is not more an issue.": 1105, "In conclusion the carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives for the benefit of their future. The carrier should inform them of the health implications, to gain emotional support and to adhere to the ethical and legal obligations.

Many third parties also show a great interest in the result especially the patient's family members. Family members have to know the result so that they can receive early treatment and have early financial and psychological preparation. Thus, I strongly agree that a carrier of a known disease risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives.": 2278, "Thirdly, RFID allows optimal patient care and safety in hospitals. Tracking of medical professionals allows them to receive notification immediately when a patient needs help. Tracking of patients ensures patient's safety by noticing if the patient is at the right place at the right time. For example, in the United States, South Tyneside District Hospital tagged newborns with RFID tags, and hid RFID readers at exit points (Masters & Michael, 2006). Unauthorized removal of baby would trigger the alarm thus enhancing baby safety (Masters & Michael, 2006). Currently, Tan Tock Seng Hospital is using ThermoSensors, a new RFID tag which is capable of patient location tracking and body temperature monitoring (Friedlos, 2009). This has enhanced patient care as nurses have more time for other patients and are notified immediately when patient has a fever (Friedlos, 2009). Unfortunately, there are several security and privacy concerns. But, these concerns can be addressed by giving individuals the choice of using RFID technology and freedom to remove tags when desired (Masters & Michael, 2006).

Although some argue that genetic testing raises ethical issue, the individual faced a lot of psychological stress such as anxiety, fear and guilt when undergoing the process of genetic testing. The individual is in ethical dilemma of whether sharing the genetic test results within the families. However, family members who are unaffected by the genetic disease may feel guilty and this condition is known as survivor guilt. To reduce the amount of psychological stress, physicians should arrange post-test genetic counselling for patients.": 749, "Finally, the third case is about the couple knowing about the genetic disorder after having children. They should tell about their health condition to prevent their future offspring to have defective genes. Since this genetic testing begins with an affected family member, it provides the best opportunity to identify relative who may be at risk for a life- threatening condition. Thus they will be undergo testing and treatment for that specific disease as soon as possible. Critics of this position may argue that disclosure brings with it the potential for loss of privacy. Is privacy is more important the health condition and welfare of your spouse and children? It is so obvious that, they did not realize that the health condition of the beloved family members is far more important rather than concerning about the intrusion of privacy. Hence, carrier of genetic disease must be obligated to tell the genetic testing result since the welfare of family members can be improved.": 1957, "Ever since Mankind has started using fossil fuels for energy, there was also an accident inbillion tonnes of carbon is released and eventually would raise world temperatures by 13 degrees Celsius (Zoe,n.d.). Global warming became an inevitable issue. Mankind's hunger for energy is ever increasing, most experts agree that fossil fuels might deplete within the next 50 years (Jo,2006). Nuclear energy was proposed to be the solution to this critical issue. There are however, concerns about nuclear power with respect to its safety, economic viability and waste disposal.

With the presence of surveillance cameras, potential criminals will thus think twice before they act. This may hence deter crimes from happening. Even though it may not be an ideal and effective way to curb criminal offenses, it can on the other hand allow authorities to work more efficiently when an incident occur. {(Shah Alam, 2007)}[HYPERLINK: http://malaysiacrimewatch.lokety.com/closed-circuit-television-cameras-to-fight-crime-in-selangor/] The use of surveillance technology to track people, under such circumstances, has once again proved to be useful and thus should not be stopped from using it.": 2282, "As genetic testing becomes more and more popart of round it have also been revealed in face of the mass public.

Nuclear power is also a promising alternative that we should not overlook. Till now nuclear scientists and engineers have already put forward the new six generation IV nuclear reactor concepts. Molten salt reactor is one of them and it adopts a molten salt mixture as a coolant in its reactor core. Here is an evaluation of the MSRs in terms of performance, safety, waste and cost, compared to traditional nuclear reactors.": 750, "Furthermore, surveillance technology can assist in monitoring potential threats. In a more specific context, monitoring is crucial to suppress transnational crime. Strict measures have beeof socialn to detect and anticipate any potential terrorist attack. Since the 9/11 incident, the United States has been keen to negotiate treaties with foreign countries on Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA): a body which ensures individuals cannot evade prosecution simply because the evidence of prosecution is located abroad (Michael & Rose, 2007). With the speed and accuracy of GPS to track any suspects related to terrorism and crime, it is crucial to identify any formidable plans or plots before disaster strikes, something which could save lives and properties. So what are the moral and ethical issues behind surveillance practice? We cannot estimate the power of data accessibility, and this greatly challenges the established basic individual right to privacy. The balance between personal privacy and national security lies on a fine line (Michael & Rose, 2007). However, the importance of the latter often outweighs the sacrifice of individual interest, with conditions that surveillance is done within the expectations of the people. For instance, a person should not expect full privacy in public places such as the streets or a shopping place.": 2489, "Nuclear power should be pursued for its environmental friendliness when compared against other forms like coal and diesel power plants and also its improved track record in safety. Nuclear power plants do not emit huge amounts of green house gases like carbon dioxide when compared against traditional coal power plants. Since the earth is experiencing global at a rate never seen before, there is a more urgent need to look into ways which we could cut down on green house gases emissions. The proposed alternative would be the use of nuclear power plants to generate electricity. There has been no major incidents involving nuclear power plants since the Chernobyl incident in 1986. Nuclear power plants now follow a very strict set of operating procedures which prevents any accidents example leakage from happening. They are heavily protected by security forces, this will deter any terrorist from attempting to hijack a nuclear plant.": 752, "There are three main aspects that RFID will benefit human beings. Firstly, it will contribute to ensuring the security of society, like \"airport security, airline security and cruise ship security\" (Greene, 2004). It is because RFID is able to efficiently detect terrorists and criminals who hide drugs in their bodies, all objects made by mental, all explosive devices and so on. In this way, public's benefits are protected as much as possible. Besides, in school, RFID can assist officers in checking people who enter and leave school so that they are capable of taking students' attendance and ensuring no unauthorized people come in simultaneously. Hence, RFID makes great contribution to our society. The second adthe government RFID is that it may save operation costs and gain more profits for companies. For example, analysts from Sanford C. Bernstein (Radio Frequency Identification Technology, n.d.) say that the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, saves as much as 8.35 billion dollars per year by applying RFID in its physical counts of inventory. It is because RFID helps to reduce Wal-Mart's operation period overwhelmingly. It takes only five minutes to finish the job which human beings need more than one day to do. Therefore, RFID is a good assistant for companies, as well as our society.": 2284, "There was no law stating safety rule for temporary structure in 2004, thus it was not significant to make the temporary structure a very well-built one. Problems arise where individual organismic perspectives come to play a part. Assumption has always been made when personnel are doing the 'assuring' job. In addition with inadequate work team activities make the design process worFpsychological LTA personnel thought that the contractors 'will' do a good job on designing the structure and do the calreduceons to ensure it is acceptable and 'assume' that the contractors already did the proper checking for the design. Assumptions are made in between both parties. As a result, they missed out 2 mistakes that can be easily spotted. First mistake is the contractors used the wrong soil analysis at the early stages of the design process. Second mistake is the contractors miscalculated the capacity of the loads for the temporary structure. Moreover, when NLC's engineer brought out an alternative analysis models, LTA's engineer rejected because he/she thought that it was overcautious. Second, the LTA's personnel, due to slothfulness, did not do his/her job on ensuring the safety of building works by performing checks on construction work. Currently, there already has a set of Safety Control Process (Seetoh Hon Hoy, 2005) for temporary structure to prevent this from happening again.": 2285, "Opponents also state that while nuclear power is indeed dangerous for that reason, it is impossible not to have accidents while working with it. An accident is a situation when there is a failure in the interaction between man and machine (Stoop, 1995). Therefore, even though nuclear power is certainly dangerous, it can still be safe to work with as long as the interaction between man and machine is designed carefully so that it will not fail. Again, this shows the importance of considering psychological factors in design process. Most of the time, while designing a system, engineers are likely to overestimate the ability of the user (Wilpert, 2007). As a result, most users are not able to properly use the equipments. In the case of Chernobyl, the plant operators failed to make the right decision which then caused the reactor to explode. Instead of following the safety procedure, the plant operators even blocked the reactor's protection system (making automatic shut down impossible) in order to keep the test running (Onisawa and Nishiwaki, 1988). If the plant operators were familiar with the system and the procedure, they would have known which one was more important and would definitely have prioritized safety rather than keeping the test running. Thus, in designing a system engineers alone are not enough.": 2417, "Another concern about nuclear power is that the radioactive waste is very hard to be dealt with. The waste needs to be carefully kept away from people for several thousand years. In addition, nuclear waste may become tools for terrorists, which is very dangerous. However, one of the concepts of the Gen = 4 \\* ROMAN IV reactors, very-high-temperature reactors (VHTR), can solve this problem. In the design of VHTR system, the radioactive uranium and plutonium will run automatically into the recycle so that it can offer an enhanced waste typo. Therefore, there will be no need to worry about the nuclear waste reprocessing.": 2286, "Nuclear power, an alternative source of electricity, could be the answer to this major problem. According to a statistic by the \"World Nuclear Association (2009)\", about 15% of the world's electricity generation comes from nuclear power. Despite being the most prominent replacement for coal and fuel, nuclear reactors received strong opposition from the public masses. The public's main concerns of nuclear reactors are the high cost of nuclear plants and nuclear research, the hazard that it poses and whether the nuclear reactors are really efficient enough to replace coal and gases. Nevertheless, further research and development funding is needed for generation IV reactor concept, namely the \"Very-High Temperature\" reactor. As cited from Idaho National Laboratory (2009), the Very-High-Temperature Reactor or \"VHTR\" is a helium-cooled reactor which is graphite-moderated, with a one time uranium fuel cycle. It uses high core outlet temperatures that enable hydrogen and electricity production. Firstly, detractors claimed that nuclear reactors and their corresponding researches cost lots of resources and money, so much that it is not economically worth taxpayer's money to build and research nuclear technologies. According to statistics from \"The Virtual Nuclear Tourist (2005)\", taking fuel, capital, operation, maintenance and waste related costs into considerations, coal cost 29.1 $/Mw-hr while nuclear power cost 30 $/Mw-hr. The difference in momentary value between conventional coal processing and nuclear power is not that big a difference. Furthermore, \"Very-High Temperature\" reactors do not need to spend any money on waste recycling as all the waste goes directly to the repository. This means that the cost of this technology is about the same, if not, lesser than conventional coal processing.": 2287, "Butler, D. (2004). Nuclear power's new dawn. Nature, 429, 238-240.

Safety and security is the primary concern when it comes to managing a business. For example, RFID tags are widely used in jewellery stores, supermarkets and boutiques. Merchandises in the respective stores are tagged with RFID tags and RFID readers will be placed at the checkout counters (Ramdasi, 2009). Once an RFID tagged item is brought out via an RFID reader, it will trigger the alarm and security guards will be alerted upon hearing the alarm. Thus, this decreases the chances of thefts. Besides that, RFID tags come in various shapes and sizes and the information contained in the RFID tags are not easily duplicated (Ramdasi, 2009). This increases the security level and efficacy of the surveillance systems in a particular area that incorporates the RFID technology.": 2292, "We are on the brink of time whereby the global warming will affect the earth severely if we don't act appropriately. The world population is 6.8 billion to the current date and is increasing rapidly (US Census Bureau, 2009). In order to provide electricity to the increasing population, governments around the world have to build more power plants to maintain undisrupted power supply to the cities. U.S. EIA, Energy Information Administration, estimated that up to 65% of energy sources for the power generators come from oil and coal (Hong, 1994). These conventional power generators contribute to the increasing trend of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, important factor for global warming. In order to stoop global warming, we must reduce carbon dioxide production. One alternative way will be the Nuclear power. Nuclear energy is produced from the fission of uranium elements in the nuclear reactors which produce massive heat. This intense heat can be converted into energy source and distributed as electricity. There are some public concerns regarding the safety and security of nuclear plants. But accidents occurred in the past were mainly because of lack of skilled workers and security (Major, 2008). In the new Generation IV reactors, the possibilities of accidents will be minimized by allowing the reactors to run at high temperatures up to 1000 degree Celsius (Butler, 2004).

Since the 9/11 incident, the United States has been keen to negotiate treaties with foreign countries on Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA): a body which ensures individuals cannot evade prosecution simply because the evidence of prosecution is located abroad (Michael & Rose, 2007). With the speed and accuracy of GPS to track any suspects related to terrorism and crime, it is crucial to identify any formidable plans or plots before disaster strikes, something which could save lives and properties. So what are the moral and ethical issues behind surveillance practice? We cannot estimate the power of data accessibility, and this greatly challenges the established basic individual right to privacy. The balance between personal privacy and national security lies on a fine line (Michael & Rose, 2007). However, the importance of the latter often outweighs the sacrifice of individual interest, with conditions that surveillance is done within the expectations of the people. For instance, a person should not expect full privacy in public places such as the streets or a shopping place.": 2302, "In conclusion, there are pros and cons regarding the improvements to hybrid cars in order to increase its level of safety.

The amount of nuclear energy given off is huge in a typical nuclear reaction, amounting to an average of 3.4 thousand billion joules per kilogram of fuel, which is about one hundred thousand times as much energy as the combustion of fuel (Gene Smith, 1999). With human population rising at an exponential rate, peaking at an estimated 9.1 billion in 2050, energy consumption is, too, expected to rise proportionally. Nuclear energy is definitely a viable option that can meet this demand.": 2219, "The last two decades witnessed drastic development in material science and digital processing technology, which made Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), an advanced surveillance technology applied in the business and tracking world.

Thus, due to the advantages of RFID technology, it should not be banned.": 2303, "RFID technology can improve the health care of the elderly. Researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology and Intel Research Seattle found out that the caregivers can monitor the seniors' daily activities through the data received via internet from the RFID readers and record when and which tagged items they have picked up (Baard, 2004). This also means that the elderly will lose their freedom in which food they eat and thing they do. However, caregivers need the real-time data and record of an individual's normal daily routine for comparison to identify any significant changes which according to the physician and expert on aging, those changes seen often indicate onset of illness and cognitive decline (Baard, 2004). Therefore, the use of RFID to track seniors' daily routine can improve their health care through early detection of health problem when they are at home.": 2304, "Second, the problems as regards to the privacy brought by the technology could be reduced or even avoided when the regulations around it tends to be more and more perfect. In fact, many great inventions and breakthroughs in the humans history have got positive and negative aspects, such as the automobiles which have brought great convenience to people while causing large damages to the environment by emitting pollution gases. And we just cannot stop using the automobiles. The only thing we can do is to improve their efficiency and seek new and green power supplies for them to make them as environmental-friendly as possible. As with the surveillance technology, we have to adopt it while making a great effort to establish a complete and reasonable set of principles surrounding it to make it more acceptable. We just cannot stop having food even though we are afraid of choking.

This will help to improve the standard of living in one country as unemptheyyment and poverty have been a constant issue for many developing countries around the world. Due to the high poverty rate and low funding from the government, electrical energy is not available in most parts of the country especially in the rural areas. One example of a developing country is Kosovo in southeast Europe sharing borders with Serbia and Macedonia. Statistics shows that in 2007, the unemployment rate in Kosovo was at 40% with 37% of their population below poverty line (Central Intelligence Agency [CIA], 2009). Therefore, developing countries should first handle unemployment and poverty in rural areas rather than provide huge funding to build Generation IV reactors.": 2306, "Surveillance technology helps prevent crime. The presentation of crime across the media for the past 30 years via television news, drama series, reality televisions, etc., has indicated that crime is a feature of modern life, and the government cannot protect the public by itself (Knepper, Doak, & Shapland, 2009). It is therefore important to allow surveillance technology to work hand-in-hand with the police force to overcome criminal puzzles without the redundant concerns over human privacy. For example, GPS 24/7 continuous real-time tracking of and individual, and is considered several times more powerful than the traditional visual surveillance often exercised by the police force (Michael & Rose, 2007). According to FOXNews.com on the 21st Of May, 2006, the authorities can now track dangerous sex offenders with GPS without keeping them in prison at taxpayer's expenses, even after serving their time. In 1999, the murder case of Valiree by William 'Brad' Jackson was solved with concrete evidence when the police force obtained a warrant to install a GPS transmitter on his truck and successfully tracked his movement to certain places which led to the discovery of the victim's body. While there are opponents raising the issue of invasion of privacy towards an individual and also the trustworthiness of the law enforcement personnel to act appropriately, justification can be done by the effectiveness of surveillance technology in bringing justice (Michael & Rose, 2007).

Nuclear plants have become prime targets of terrorists. This is because the plutonium waste that the nuclear reactor produces are ingredients for making nuclear weapons. Hence, security of nuclear plants is strengthened as well to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons. If nuclear weapons were to fall in the hands of terrorists, it would pose a great threat to the safety of the public. However in VHTR, plutonium are spiked with heat producing and radioactive elements (Butler, 2004). These elements cause the plutonium waste to increase in temperature such that it is too hot to handle and therefore prevent anyone from stealing them. Hence, the public does not need to worry about nuclear waste falling in the hands of the terrorists.": 2311, "Last but not the least, VHTR is designed to be a highefficiency reactor, meaning that it can help to make great economic profit. On the other hand, scientists support Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) because both its coolant and fuel can use same liquid salts to save materials. And MSR operates in closed fuel cycle to avoid waste the fuel and coolant. Unfortunately, MSR has a death-blow, the resulting corrosion of reactor components after long-term chemistry and handling of molten salt. As mentioned that VHTR acts as high efficiency design, besides normal production of electricity it also supplies heat with core outlet temperature of 1000 Celsius (Forsberg, 2008). With the heat, it is efficient to process petrochemical industry or sea water desalination. And the most important application is hydrogen production. Since hydrogen is one of the clearest energy in the world and it is not easy to produce, the heat produced by VHTR can help to solve this big problem. In addition, compared with conventional plants, VHTR also can produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel (Butler, 2004). As a result, VHTR can provide a more economic energy to meet the demand of the world. In general, it is valuable to research and develop VHTR to meet the goals of new generation in future, since it has significant advantages among the six Generation IV reactors. First it has advanced safe design, which can automatically cool itself down when accident without additional operating system. Secondly, VHTR has high sustainability and is also environmental friendly. Last it provides a more efficient system, thus the economic benefits from it cannot be neglected.

Too much electricity would pose a danger to the vehicle as a whole in the event of an accident and will also affect the performance of the car itself.

Surveillance cameras installed at strategic areas will ensure that suspicious characters could be filtered out by the security personnel for checks while RFID tags on prisoners would ensure that they do not escape (Swedberg 2005) and pose a danger to the public. As one would remember, the escape of the terrorist Mas Selamat in Singapore had threatened the security of the city and the neighbouring countries. Deployment of large number of troops to capture him was futile until he was arrested by the Malaysian police one year later. If a RFID tag had been used, the terrorist would not be able to escape easily.

To reduce the probability of radioactive elements leaking to the atmosphere or damage to the plants, there must be an emphasis on the human factors pertaining to plant operations.

Also, it might be very difficult to safely recover the waste once it has been placed in the seabed. As this is not the case for SFR, it is rated higher in terms of waste disposal.

As Wilpert (2007) states, safety of engineering design depends on three things, namely, effective process, production control and failure avoidance. However, the Chernobyl reactor, reactor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalniy (RBMK), was designed with problems of all these three aspects. Firstly, in the RBMK reactor, the process of insertion of rods, which are to regulate the reaction speed, is inefficient and there is no fast rod for emergency. It takes 20 seconds for a full insertion and this is too slow to prevent the core from running away when the reaction is under the unstable mode (Frot, 2001). Moreover, the rods are designed with graphite tip which, when first inserted, will increase the reactivity. Secondly, the production control of RBMK is poor. The core of the reactor is unstable at low power. When the accident happened, the reactor was at a test of low power, working with only a quarter of full power. Thirdly, the RBMK reactor has almost nothing to prepare for out coming gases. Without either a system to filter exhaust neither gases nor a containment structure (Frot, 2001), the release of radioactivity could quickly spread in all directions and causes more serious results. As analyzed, by removing the errors above, the accident can be prevented. Hence psychology should be functional for preventing the accident.": 2348, "One of the most practical issues concern is the cost. Countries want to build reactors that are cheap in cost and that are efficient in producing electricity and hydrogen gases. For the VHTR Model when compared to the MSR, the construction of the plant is costly and takes up a relatively large space. The construction of the plant is costly as it requires materials that can withstand the extreme heat and corrosive operating condition of the reactor. The molten salt is preferred as it operation system is less complicated which means that it is cheaper to construct and it does not need to run on very high temperature or pressure. However, in term of the overall development cost, the Very High temperature Reactors is still much cheaper than the Molten Salt reactor. The cost is 679 million dollars compared to the 1000 million required by the MSR (NERAC). This is so as the VHTR is simply the upgrading of existing high temperature reactors while the MSR is a relative new technology. Hence VHTR need less testing and less time to develop whereas extensive testing is required for the MSR.": 2349, "http://www3.inter{science.wiley.com/journal/112684945/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0}[HYPERLINK: http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112684945/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0]": 789, "Another issue now is that individual's privacy is not respected as insurance companies without their consent show their results to relatives. Insurance companies might have gotten hold of individual's positive genetic tests without their consent to show their relatives why their insurance premiums were jerked up (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, 2004) or to explain why their bid to get insured was rejected (Ostrom, 1997). Then again, if relatives know that a genetic disease is hereditary and went for a genetic test to prove that they do not have the mutation that would put them at a higher risk of developing the disease, they would be able to get insured earlier (Ostrom, 1997). Although there are regulations to prevent insurers from discriminating people with a higher chance of getting certain genetic diseases The Changes in Health Care Financing and Organization (HCFO), 2005), it might lead to higher insurance premium for everyone.

Naturally, The public would have an impression that VHTR would be much more expensive, comparatively to renewable energy such as solar and wind. However, this is not the case. VHTR will be cheaper as cost incurred oisransportation of nuclear waste is redundant. This is because the nuclear waste goes directly to a respiratory which is located within the nuclear plant (Clayton 2009). Furthermore, VHTR produces cheaper energy compit to solar and wind energy. Barry (2009) cites that the capital cost of building a solar plant is 25 times more than nuclear plant and the land area solar plant occupies is 400 times more than nuclear plant.

In September 2009, another accident gave Russia a huge hit. Russia's biggest hydroelectric power plant in Sayano-Shushenskaya had a big explosion accident. 75 workers were killed and one person was reported missing in the accident. The top industrial safety official in Russia stated that human's negligence was the major factor in the devastation of the accident. One part of an overstrained turbine unit which weighted 1,500 tons snapped off from its restraining bolts and flow 14 meters into the air, causing floods. Due to flooding in the plant, short circuits crippled the plant and exploded. It is said that the cost of repairing the damage would be over $1.2 billion and the duration to recover the damage would take two years.": 2458, "Second, safety is another important factor. For the sodium-cooled fast reactor, it is a primary system that operates near atmospheric pressure and important features of the system include a long thermal response time which is a large margin to cool the boiling. It also offers a high level of safety reliability. This fact is based on active safety countermeasures for self-controlled shutdown function and cooling function. However, dynamic simulations indicate that an accidental reduction of flow up to 2-3 can be tolerated (with no control action) without sodium boiling or fuel melting. Obviously, the most significant part of the safety features of the sodium- cooled fast reactor is the control action. Thus, no matter which generation IV reactor is used, if its system has control action, it is also relatively safe. Furthermore, the gas-cooled fast reactor also has its own control action in the system. This control makes the gas-cooled fast reactor as safe as the sodium-cooled fast reactor. Third, the cost of the fast reactor is also significant. Some evidence shows the sodium-cooled fast reactor can reduce the cost of the raw material by changing the materials used. However, as the sodium-cooled fast reactor was developed later than the other kinds of reactors, especially later than the gas-cooled fast reactor, the cost of research and investigation of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is so huge. Because of this, many developed countries do not have enough money to build a sodium-cooled fast reactor. Therefore, the application of the sodium-cooled fast reactor is hindered. Compared with the sodium-cooled fast reactor, the gas-cooled fast factor is an old one which has been developed and widely used since 1979. Its cost of development is far less than that of the sodium-cooled fast reactor. It does not need to be changed or improved so much. Its main cost is just the annual depreciation which is far less than the development cost of the sodium- cooled reactor. In addition, we should consider the cost of time of the reactors. The gas-cooled fast reactor can be used directly at once. However, the sodium-cooled fast reactor should be checked for several years before it could be used.

In Reason(2000)'s article, he notices a distinctive element that separates high reliability organizations from others. This element is the consensual agreement that errors can occur anywhere and every stage in should be treated meticulously.

The management committee of the Challenger space shuttle actually got a warning report about the high risk before the launch. They were informed that the O-ring might fail to seal the fuel tank due to the low temperature. However, in response to such a crucial warning report, they put it aside and left it to chance (The Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster, 2009). It was a totally irresponsible action. Conceding that officials in NASA may have been used to high risk operation and there are certain times when the system needs to operate at high risk (Feynman, Richard Phillips,1992), the managers cannot straightaway ignore the problem just because the chance for the accident to take place is slim. Their underestimation of the danger resulted in the Challenger accident directly. If psychology could been used in their decision, if they could have thought more about their work which related to the safety of other people and the outcome of the entire program, if they really have had the sense of responsibility which results from the essence of their job, they would not rush their work and make irresponsible decision.

For instance, solar energy is produced when the sun is shining. During the night or bad weather, the expensive solar equipment will be useless. Also the amount of electric energy produced from this technology is far less than current power plants. It is not feasible to build many solar or tidal powers all around the lands and seas. On the other hand, Nuclear energy does not have all these limitations. Fuel sources for it are virtually unlimited and could last much longer than fossil fuels. Nuclear energy is also regarded as one of the clean energy available today as it doesn't produce any pollutants that contribute to environmental problems. It is possible for nuclear to be the mainstream energy production when combined with other renewable energy such as solar power.

Proponents of VHTR claim that it has an inherent passive safety features for both the fuel and the reactor (Goethem 2008). For example, the core of the reactor will be able to withstand temperatures way above the normal operating temperatures. In the event of an accident, the probability of a meltdown occurring is minimized. However, passive safety features are present in the MSR too. Unlike the VHTR which produces high pressure steam at the core, MSR produces low pressure. This is due to the nature of molten fluoride salts, which is used as coolant and is mechanically and chemically stable at sea-level pressures (Forsberg 2004). In other words the MSR's core cannot have a steam explosion, thus it eliminates the need for additional advance technology to control the high pressure. Due to VHTR's high temperature and corrosive operating conditions, the materials used must have high dimensional stability and be able to withstand high pressure. New ultra hard materials that can resist continued high temperatures and intense bombardment by neutrons have to be developed (Butler). Practical advantages of MSR's high temperature low pressure cooling result in higher efficiency in removing heat from the core (Fosberg 2004). This also implies that MSR does not need to spend additional money developing new materials to withstand the high pressure.": 2390, "There is a need for our world to move towards nuclear energy due to three reasons.

After the deployment of nuclear plant, more funds are needed for insurance coverage, maintenance and labor. Hence, nuclear energy may not be worth it. In the case of SCWR, due to the presence of high pressure and possible corrosion, the expenditure on research and maintenance will be high. However, the other reactors also face challenges that require substantial technological and financial supports. If the ratio of energy output and all inputs is considered, the rate of return of SCWR is faster than the others, not mentioning the low price of the electricity when the design is successful. Then the traditional oil or coal generators will be disadvantaged because of the rarity of these non-renewable resources. Moreover, comparing with the other five ideas which use inert gas, liquid compound or metal as coolants, water is much easily accessed and present in relative abundance. Thus, the manufacturing process of coolant is simpler for SCWR, and also cheaper. Also, due to the presence of light water reactors, there is already extensive worldwide experience in constructing and operating this sort of reactor. This saves a lot of experiments and provides information for scientists. The experience minimizes the chances of any experimental failure and in turn saves the research funds.

An example is the Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) which boasts a super helium coolant which is much more effective than water, and yet it is both inert and unreactive (Teri Ehresman, 2009). It also has ultra hard ceramic materials which are heat resistant and very safe if meltdown were to occur. The by-products of VHTR are hard to extract and the usable amount is of insignificant amount. These generation IV reactors can only be realized if everyone sees the benefit of nuclear energy and supports the research for it.": 2397, "To begin with, some of opponents will argue that the cost of building a nuclear reactor is too high and the cost mentioned above generally comprises of research, development, regulation, construction costs, and the contribution to the nuclear waste fund. Frankly speaking, some of this problem does really exist, but we can view it from another perspective, which means comparing its cost with other kind of power plant under all the same factors. Firstly, the cost of constructing a nuclear reactor is at most 2 to 3 times than the cost of building a heat-energy reactor with the same output. But the raw material like uranium enrichment used for nuclear reactor is much cheaper both in transport and price under the same amount of energy output. In addition, unlike the heat-energy reactor, the gas emitted during the operation has a little influence on the environment and global warming. Lastly, the achievement obtained from the research can also be applied into other fields.": 2398, "Surveillance technology such as RFID technology is used for the purpose of monitoring changes, behaviour, activities and keeping track of mainly humans and sometimes, animals. RFID technology has been around for more than 10 years and it is used by different bodies or organizations (Ramdasi, 2009). Thus, it is not something uncommon among our society as it is incorporated in many applications of our daily lives such as tracking people and animals. The acronym RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identification and it is widely used in different industries. We may rely too much on RFID technology that it may take a toll on some of us. This has resulted in the raise of privacy and ethical issues within our society. However, it has been known that RFID technology brings benefits to various elements of our lives and it helps in solving problems that we may encounter while handling different tasks and even correct human errors. Hence, RFID technology such as human implants and RFID tags should be used to monitor people.": 2399, "Furthermore, surveillance technologies also can be used to improve the social security. Equipped with these surveillance technologies, our family member can locate us easily and hence decrease the kidnapping rate. This application is proven to be effective when the Mexican Agency tried to use these surveillance technologies to curb the kidnapping epidemic in the country. In the same time, United States also implemented the usage of surveillance technologies in their prison to control the violence rate. The 60% decrease in the violence rate in these prisons proved that surveillance technology is effective in preventing the violence from happening ( {Kanellos}[HYPERLINK: mailto:michael.kanellos@cnet.com],M., 2004).

This means that the technology is already quite well established and thus less time is needed to research on the basic technology that will be used in VHTR as compared to the other power plants that may involve the use of totally new technologies. In times like this where the price of fossil fuel and coal is sky rocketing, an earlier delivery date of 5 years for an efficient energy alternative is very crucial.

This concern is reasonable because if the surgeon is not familiar with the system, he may take longer time for the surgery and thus create a risk. To avoid this kind of risk happening in Singapore, a training center should be set up in each hospital. Professional engineers and foreign experts are invited to train the local surgeons with certain hours of practicing to ensure the surgeons are fully familiar with the system and will be able to perform in real situation. Now, if the surgeons are well trained, the robot will eventually increase the efficiency of the surgeons. According to Wiley (ScienceDaily, 2009), if the surgeon is well trained, using robots could help him perform many surgical tasks without other human assistants. This is beneficial especially in case of Singapore as there are limited skilled assistants available in hospital.

However, in the 1986 Europe, the level of technology and knowledge available was limited and the understanding of the use of psychology was constrained. This resulted in flaws of the construction in its cooling system and containment structure of the plant itself, leading to the escapade of the harmful radiation into the environment when everything collapsed.

They do not believe this idea of seabed disposal will work. Even with deep trenches used, it is possible that life forms living in it would bring back the still harmful nuclear waste back into contact with other life forms. Also, it might be very difficult to safely recover the waste once it has been placed in the seabed. As this is not the case for SFR, it is rated higher in terms of waste disposal.

Proponents of VHTR claim that it has an inherent passive safety feature for both the fuel and the reactor (Goethem 2008). For example, the core of the reactor will be able to withstand temperatures way above the normal operating temperatures. In the event of an accident, the probability of a meltdown occurring is minimized. However, passive safety features are present in the MSR too. Unlike the VHTR which produces high pressure steam at the core, MSR produces low pressure. This is due to the nature of molten fluoride salts, which are used as coolant and are mechanically and chemically stable at sea-level pressures (Forsberg 2004). In other words the MSR's core cannot have a steam explosion; thus, it eliminates the need for additional advanced technology to control the high pressure. Due to VHTR's high temperature and corrosive operating conditions, the materials used must have high dimensional stability and be able to withstand high pressure. New ultra hard materials that can resist continued high temperatures and intense bombardment by neutrons have to be developed (Butler).

Opponents of this position argue that the family members may hastily undergo a genetic test on receiving the negative news without careful consideration of the possible discrimination that they may face after the genetic test (Agatha M et al., 2009). Admittedly, it is true that one may face discrimination at work and from insurance companies after a genetic test (US National Institute of Health, 1998). However, with the setting up of legislative law by governments, such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act in the United States, the risk of discrimination at work or from insurance companies will be kept to a minimum (US National Institute of Health, 1998).

Infants who inherit this disorder will look perfectly normal during the first 6 months of their birth. Failure to identify and treat Phenylketonuria in time however may result in mental illness at later stages of an infant's life.(Schuett, 2008) There are some who think that the disclosure of a genetic testing result is unnecessary and they argue that it may bring immense grief and worry to their relatives. However, without being warned of the possible risk of inheriting these diseases, they would probably not go for their own genetic testing and hence would run the risk of having a late treatment to a disease related to genetic disorder which may have catastrophic consequences.": 2467, "Firstly, it is undeniable that RFID is very useful in daily life.

Not everyone is able to get an implant without side effects because each person's immunity system differs from one another. In addition, patients might suffer severe burns. There's a possibility that the implanted transponder will migrate and travel in the body, causing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) incongruence and electromagnetic interference. An MRI machine utilizes strong magnetic fields along with pulsed radio frequency fields that may induce electrical currents in conductive metal implants such as the RFID tags (CASPIAN Special Report, 2004).

All these technologies are to deter and detect enemies so countries are not caught unawares should enemies invade. However, these systems are not without flaws as it was reported that Korean Air Lines Flight 007 strayed and was shot down in a Soviet no-fly zone (Gately, 2009).

However, the generation IV reactors are able to burn existing prolonged nuclear waste, produce only a little amount of waste that will last for decades only (Hansen, 2008). These wastes are stored into a special concrete storage cylinder to prevent the radiation from leaking to the environment. Besides that, the nuclear reactor design strategy of generation IV reactors for preventing accidents and mitigating their potential effects is defense in depth (Cohen, n.d). This will mean that there will always be a backup system to limit the harm done if something fails. If that backup system should also fail, there will always be another back-up system to replace it.

Furthermore, the world today require more energy and the energy demand is not met with the existing renewable resources as they have their own limitations. For, example, wind energy cannot be tapped on non-windy days and solar energy cannot be tapped at night.

If the country supplying power to Italy decides to stop importing power to it, Italy's economy would come to a halt. Furthermore, it would destabilize the society and would potentially cause political instability as people would be unhappy with no electricity in the country. For example, citizens living in the village Banthara did not participate in the elections in India as they were upset over having little access to electricity CITATION Kam09 \\l 1033 (Hajela, 2009).

In terms of research I would be focusing on the poor and dependent segment of the aging population who require housing and accessible infrastructure. One of the basic elements of the well-being of elderly person is housing, it must be assured during the entire period of old age, household composition and living arrangements, physical strength and mobility, and the relations of the elderly with other generations (J D Harrison). The singles and lonely elderly who do not have any children of their own would usually stay with their next-of-kin. These elderly could also own a house. The Studio apartment scheme (Housing Development Board [HDB], 2009) was introduced to provide an alternative housing option for the elderly. The Studio apartments are build small to cater to the independent living of elderly. These apartments are constructed in a ready-to-move-in condition within the existing public housing. In addition, this type of alternative housing is a cheaper means of shelter and is customized with elder-friendly features to facilitate independent living and mobility. Voluntary welfare organizations (VWOs) are providing exclusive supporting services for the occupants like a VWO-run seniors housing (Committee on Aging Issue [CAI], 2006). This is also an alternative to the minority of the elderly who prefer to live independently and not add on to the burden of their child. Old age would usually be associated with the physical changes and limitations of an elderly. As they starts to age, their physical capability would start to reduce and change. Mobility, which is one of the activities of daily living (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1984), would be hindered by this change of physical capability. The safety of the elderly parents would be one of the main concerns for the caregiver. Being old and vulnerable, the elderly would require special safety measures taken around the house, so as to eliminate the possible safety threats. Housing Development Board has helped to design a more elderly friendly environment through the Project LIFE (Project to Improve the Living Conditions of the Elderly) (HDB, 2005). Where the housing flats with high concentration of poor elderly persons are upgraded with new fixtures and fittings, features such as lifts modification on every level, support hand grips in toilet, tap lever, non-slip floor tiles, and an alert alarm system. Such installation of elderly-friendly features would enhance the mobility of older residents. This enables the elderly to live independently while being assured of help if needed. These improvement works are fully funded by the government. Children can be more assured of the safe quality living of elderly. Elderly are encouraged to integrate into the community and be self- dependent (CAI, 2006). Being part of the community would create a sense of belonging for the elderly which promote better mental health. According to Committee of Aging Issue, making Singapore an \"Accessible City\" (CAI, 2006) would be the first step to reaching outward to the community. The development of an \"Accessible City\" creates a long term benefit for all citizens. Creating a barrier free environment would give the elderly person of freedom of moving around the community. This allows elderly person to integrate into a wider community and lead life actively. Barrier-free environment could be done by upgrading the roads and infrastructures between housing and buildings according to the Code of Barrier-Free Accessibility (BCA, 2002). Code of Barrier-Free Accessibility (BCA, 2002) are adhere to the conditions of being elderly friendly and barrier-free. This can assure that the elderly are living in a safe and unobstructed environment. As part of the \"Accessible City\", transportation is also included. The public transport operators have made adjustment to all the new public buses with low floor step-free and wheelchair-accessible to allow everyone to use the public transportation system. The government also helps to defray the addition cost involved. Singapore being a small country with only 682.7 sq km (CIA World Factbook, 2009) faces the problems of land scarcity. Singapore faces immense challenges in trying to meet the housing needs for its growing population. There are insufficient lands for construction of basic residential housing, let alone these types of additional housing and infrastructure that caters to the elderly. Building of additional housing and infrastructures would cost a huge amount of money. All these costs are defrayed by the government. These funds come from the tax payer, if huge amount of the funds are channeled into this particular area. Are there sufficient funds left for the other area of national development? This would leads to more constraints and limitation than solving the issues of aging population. The mentioned several development and policies made have helped to ease the aging process. The developments of housing and infrastructures have helped to meet their physical, social and recreational needs and facilitate their integration into the community. The elderly are able to be self-dependent. However, all these practices should be done with the understanding of the limitations and constrains. Policy and development should be made at an economical level, not too extravagant to enhance their life but to improve the necessary condition of the elderly life. These policies would then serve to help ease the aging society.": 898, "Edition.

Therefore, the second advantage of VHTR is because VHTR doesn't produce any nuclear waste. VHTR could even generate hydrogen at the same time under its high temperature. We may cut the cost spending using nuclear waste when we use VHTR. Hydrogen has its high thermal value and can also be used without any pollution. VHTR uses Helium as its coolant instead today's water-cooled reactors and transfers energy into hydrogen which surely saves the source.

As predicted, a generation IV reactor design is not to be realized before 2030. With some degree of uncertainty over the possibilities of putting a VHTR into operation, such a huge bill is difficult to be issued anytime soon. Moreover, alternative solutions of fuel are not necessarily constrained by generation IV reactors as sources like solar power which require much less funding than the reactors are being intensely researched upon. Hence the realization of VHTR is not as cost competitive as those alternatives. Another problem is that the researches into the materials required by the containers and pipes are not going to produce useful results in the near future. Due to the fact that the VHTR should withstand extremely high temperatures, the materials for the chamber must be ultra hard and corrosion resistant, many times better than those that we have already discovered.

This has caused us to oppose new nuclear plant projects. Our dependence on fossil fuels necessarily needs to reduce because of its depletion and possible exhaustion in the near future and also due to the harmful effects on the environment by using them. This makes shifting to alternative sources of fuel inevitable. Newer ideas and technological improvements are possible if the necessary funding is directed towards the research of nuclear power and technologies like them. Since, nuclear power does not affect the environment as drastically as fossil fuels, if its waste is well managed, and provides much higher ration of power to the amount of fuel used, it is the most feasible fuel source available to us. Of the various nuclear power plant technologies, the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is the safest. Implementing this reactor for power production is an achievable goal to set for a sooner transformation to nuclear power. Since the VHTR uses helium as a coolant, it can go to temperatures of up to 10000C as compared the 3000C of the earlier reactors as the earlier reactors use high pressured water as their coolant. Another fascinating fact is that the VHTR's waste goes back to its repository and that it can produce hydrogen from water due to its high working temperature. The above mentioned facts distinguish the VHTR from the Generation III reactors and define reactors like the VHTR and the VHTR itself as a \"model of the Generation IV reactors\" (Clair, 2005).

They are designed to be human independent whenever an accident occurs. With this safety feature, accidents due to human errors could be prevented and would no longer be an issue. In addition, the VHTR uses materials that have low reactivity and high temperature endurance. (wapedia, page 4, Para 2) One example would be the usage of helium as the coolant which has no reactivity effects. (wapedia, page 3, Para 1) With all these aspects of safety taken into consideration, the public should be ensured that nuclear power plants would be a safe source of energy.": 914, "It is understood that with the building of Generation IV nuclear reactors, it will generate a large amount of jobs like hard labour during construction phase and highly skilled engineers for day to day maintenance and operation.

They took light of their task since for them this was just another safety test. They did not have any sense of responsibility and were not aware of the consequences if anything went wrong. Therefore, during the design process, these plant operators are supposed to be 'designed' as well.

Genetic discrimination occurs when an external party gains access to an individual's health records or when one is honest in declaring one's health condition.

Furthermore, employers will be judgmental in hiring or firing a 'sick' employee. In America, a new federal law referred to as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, to prevent discrimination from insurance companies and employers (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2009). Genetic discrimination will not take place if the individual had the final say in revealing the result of such testing, as the individual had withheld the information and life would go on as per normal until the disease presents its signs and symptoms. When the individual is discovered for having a genetic disorder and not declaring the status beforehand, the individual will bear all the consequences, which includes genetic discrimination since the individual had the choice to weigh on the pros and cons of the matter before the individual made a decision on keeping the condition to himself.

The Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SWCR) is one of the most popular generation IV concepts of nuclear power. Like the old nuclear reactors, the promotion of SWCR is opposed by some people because of security, environment, performance and cost issues. However, with its unique advantages and the global demand of energy, it is reasonable and to some extent necessary to support further research funding of SWCR. With the great destructions done by the explosion of some previous reactors, some people still oppose SWCR for concerning of security and environmental issues. It is still remember that in 1979 at Three Mile Island, the reactor exploded and killed 31 at once and spewed radioactive across Europe. But SWCR is much safer and reliable compared with the old reactors. It would include simplified safety features that do not rely on sophisticated backup systems or experienced operatorsall are, in principle, 'melt down proof' of an accident with minimal, if any, human intervention (Butler, D. 2004). This suggests that any attempt to trigger an accident deliberately by simply switching off the coolant or power supply would be in vain. Besides, it generates little waste and some of them can be recycled. Actually it is much cleaner than many other forms of energy that emits too much green-house gas and various pollutions. Some opponents may question the performance of SWCR. They doubt that whether or not it is more efficient than other old reactors. For this question, SWCR gives us a satisfactory answer. The SWCR system is built on two technologies: Light Water Reactors and supercritical fossil-fired boilers. It uses extremely high pressure to prevent water from boiling at temperature up to 500.Thus the thermal efficiency is greatly improved, about 45% versus about 33% efficiency for current Light Water Reactors (Idaho National Laboratory: Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor). Although nuclear energy is an effective energy form, it is quite demanding in terms of technology and the cost may be not acceptable. Some people may question that whether SWCR is good enough to be applied widely, especially in developing countries. Actually SWCR is simple to design and built that largely lower its cost. This is because it has a fast neutron spectrum to generate more power for the same size of reactor and it resembles traditional LWR fuel. Hence Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor is applicable for more countries. Some countries even consider building such kind of nuclear plants in large scales.": 2570, "According to the latest energy consumption statistics in 2008, the majority of energy consumption was still made up of oil, coal and natural gas 34.8%, 24.2% and 24.1% respectively. However, the fact behind the door is that under the current consumption pace, no more than 50 years the oil and natural gas will use up and the coal reserve can also only sustain 120 years more. Faced with the unprecedented energy crisis, finding an alternative energy resource has naturally become the top priority issue. For the present, nuclear energy is gradually playing increasingly vital role in the energy supply due to its high efficiency and abundant raw materials. However, some of the public are still concerning some of the issues associated with the nuclear energy, for example the cost, safety and performance. The concern is understanding, since the nuclear catastrophe happened in Chernobyl on 26 April 1986 is still fresh in our mind. But those disasters are mainly result from the human's wrong operation.

However, such an accident will not happen again, that is because nowadays all nuclear reactors that are currently in operation worldwide are placed inside a containment building. Unfortunately, the reactor in Chernobyl was not in such an infrastructure. The containment building helps to keep the radiation inside in the case of the faulty operation of the reactor. Its ability to prevent the leak of radiation was proved in 1979, at Three Mile Island, the reactor core meltdown. It should have cause major impact to people living there, but in fact, no injuries or deaths occurred because of the presence of the containment building.( Donald W. Miller,2004).

On the other hand the VHTR is more expensive to build; materials have to withstand high temperatures as well as high pressures. Though the capital cost of the VHTR is high the operational cost is comparatively less since the VHTR is highly efficient at higher temperature and hence is a good solution to get cheaper electricity. Some may argue that the VHTR has too high a capital cost, a prototype would cost 1Billion US dollars, and hence it is expensive, but many countries have shown great interests in the development of the VHTR, and the cost of Research and Development, therefore will be split amongst several countries.

Countries around the globe are all working for a better quality of life, this drives the demand for energy on the hike. There are various ways generating electricity. However, if a mixture of energy production options is continued, it will impact the environment adversely and cause climate change in long term. Therefore we need to produce energy which is clean, safe, abundant and cost-effective. Nuclear power plants are providing 16% of the electricity in the world which are the largest share provided by non- greenhouse-gas-emitting source (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems, 2002). It has significantly decreased the environmental impact of energy generation. Nuclear energy can generate hydrogen which is important for petroleum refinement and can be used as an oil alternative in transportation. Many countries of the world, both industrialized and developing, believe that nuclear energy can be used to meet their demand because of its sustainability in long-term and absence of environmental impacts. The concept of Generation IV Nuclear Energy System (NES) is able to meet this demand and is inevitable in implementation. In 2001, founding members of the GIF selected six best designs as reactor prototypes for the future (Butler, 2004). The GFR (or Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor) system is one of them. The GFR is primarily developed to produce electricity and is able to support hydrogen production from water. There are different models and the reference reactor is a 600-MWth/288-MWe, helium-cooled system operating with an outlet temperature of 850\u00b0C using a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems, 2002). With ongoing Research & Development (R&D) for its related technology, the GFR is predicted to be delivered by 2025. Though questions have been raised on its pending features of development, the GFR should be chosen as the research prototype due to its performance, safety and economics features. Features of GFR There has been doubt on the safety of the GFR system. \"The fundamental safety objective is to protect people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation\" (Fundamental Safety Principles, 2006). Another aspect of safety is the Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection (PR and PP). It is also one of the objectives of a Generation IV NES is to \"increase the assurance that they are a very unattractive and the least desirable route for diversion or theft of weapons-usable materials, and provide increased physical protection against acts of terrorism\" (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems, 2002). To address this, GFR system has involved measures to enhance PR & PE and has adopted an actinide management to ensure nuclear waste utilization and availability of fuel in long term. Some people argue that the reprocessing of waste is unsafe. However, there has not been solid proof of accidents. Furthermore, new forms of reprocessing will be improved. Technologically, research on the core design, materials, and fuels is still ongoing. With the effort of scientists and researchers, the GFR will be safely deployable if the technical hurdles are overcome. Supporters of other reactors believe that they have better performance. Research has shown that the GFR system ranks the top for its sustainability (Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor, 2005). Like the VHTR system, GFR uses helium as coolant which has a high outlet temperature of 850\u00b0C, making it able to split hydrogen from water. This is ideal for countries largely dependent on oil import because hydrogen is an important oil alternative used in fuel cells. Reprocessing also enhances the performance as it could cut the final amount of waste up to 96% (Butler, 2004). The elements with long half-life are extracted and reused. Only a small volume of waste is left behind. Another debatable issue is the cost of building the GFR system. Each of the six prototype costs about US$1 billion (Butler, 2004). However in long term, the cost is justified by the economics-of-scale. It is also a research emphasis to achieve low system cost (Khalil, n.d). For the gas- cooled reactors, this might be done by considering other coolants such as the S-CO2, replacing the cladding materials and so on.": 2576, "In conclusion, further research and development funding for nuclear power should be supported.

However, research has been done and no potential has been reportedfor further improving the process of tapping renewable energy.

Furthermore, the world today requires more energy and the energy demand is not met with the existing renewable resources as they have their own limitations. For, example, wind energy cannot be tapped on non-windy days and solar energy cannot be tapped at night. This causes a country to lose out its profits as the production in industries could not be carried out if there is not enough energy supply. Hence, due to our growing energy needs we need to concentrate on the generation IV Reactors. Italy initially constructed 4 nuclear reactors but shut all of them down after the Chernobyl accident. However the Prime Minister of Italy, Berlusconi, and the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, signed an agreement which states that the two countries would work together to bring back nuclear power in Italy. Initially, Italy had no back up energy source on its own and needed to depend on other countries. In fact, Italy had more than 80% of its energy supplied by other countries. Italy now plans to build nuclear reactors as it does not want to depend heavily on other countries for energy. If the country supplying power to Italy decides to stop exporting power to it, Italy's economy would come to a halt. Furthermore, it would destabilize the society and would potentially cause political instability as people would be unhappy with no electricity in the country. For example, citizens living in the village Banthara did not participate in the elections in India as they were upset over having little access to electricity (Hajela, 2009).

Despite the negative points of the VHTR, it is still way ahead of the MSR and all other generation IV models, only VHR has an efficiency of more than fifty percent.

On the other hand, scientists support Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) because both its coolant and fuel can use same liquid salts to save materials. And MSR operates in closed fuel cycle to avoid waste the fuel and coolant. Unfortunately, MSR has a death-blow, the resulting corrosion of reactor components after long-term chemistry and handling of molten salt. As mentioned that VHTR acts as high efficiency design, besides normal production of electricity it also supplies heat with core outlet temperature of 1000 Celsius (Forsberg, 2008). With the heat, it is efficient to process petrochemical industry or sea water desalination. And the most important application is hydrogen production. Since hydrogen is one of the clearest forms of energy in the world and it is not easy to produce, the heat produced by VHTR can help to solve this big problem. In addition, compared with conventional plants, VHTR also can produce 50% more electricity from the same amount of fuel (Butler, 2004). As a result, VHTR can provide more economic energy to meet the demand of the world. In general, it is valuable to research and develop VHTR to meet the goals of new generation in future, since it has significant advantages among the six Generation IV reactors. First it has advanced safe design, which can automatically cool itself down when accident without additional operating system.

After the 911 incident, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) enforced strict rules and regulations on the nuclear power plants. (Order Code RS21131, 2005) These include having all nuclear plants licensed by NRC to be protected by layers of physical barriers and a highly trained security force. Another benefit that comes with this heighten security is the generation of more jobs helping to ease unemployment rate. NRC also requires the power plants to conduct regular security and evacuation exercises which will be closely monitored by NRC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). (Order Code RS21131, 2005) Furthermore, a decades-long test and analysis portrayed that actual radioactivity escaping from molten fuel is less than initial assumption as the nuclear activity slows down a lot when it is not in the internal structure of the reactor. Also the containment structures of modern reactors were designed to effectively prevent the escape of radioactivity even if it sustained severe damages.(Safety, 2008) These factors would certainly ease the minds of people worrying about the security and safety issues of nuclear reactors. In contrast to the two other alternative sources of energy, the cost of building a nuclear reactor is higher than a wind turbine or solar panel. Also since a wind turbine or solar panel are more unlikely to be in a terrorist's hit list than a nuclear plant, cost of maintaining security of them are relative less. But in contrast to what many people would think, even a generation III reactor used today have structures that can sustain a plane crashing into it. In addition, a MSR uses an integrated fuel cycle system where it uses its molten salts as its fuel as well as its coolant. (GIF, 2007) MSR has lower fissile inventories and no need to spend on ways to handle solid fuels. (Gen IV reactors, 2009) Moreover, newer advanced reactors have simpler designs which further reduce capital cost and they are more fuel efficient and safer. (Advanced Reactors, 2009) The construction of wind turbines and solar panels are very space consuming because of their low energy efficiency and they are unreliable as they are weather dependent. (Gibson, 2007) Although nuclear reactors too need large area of land space, the great energy output it has compensated for it. All the alternative energy mentioned are green compared to the burning of fossil fuels in terms of emission to environment. But some still feel that wind and solar energy are greener than nuclear energy due to the nuclear waste. Since the first generation of nuclear reactors, advancement in technology has greatly increased the fuel efficiency thus cutting down on the waste. (Gen IV Reactors, 2009) Furthermore, MSR's fuel doubles up as its coolant due to the good heat transportation properties of molten salts further reduce on the waste produced. Due to the nature of MSR, its waste has lower amount of radioactivity, safer due to passive cooling up to any size and very low fuel usage.

However, when a carrier's family know well about her health condition, she will receive more care, which is better for her in keeping her health in a good condition. Furthermore, telling relatives the results also help the carriers. They will receive more encouragement, as well as other helps in money, medicine and so on (Croft, 2009).

The implementation of such a system has successfully foiled some of the terrorist's plan. Furthermore, individual would behave themselves upon knowing that they are constantly being \"watched\", leading to a possible decrease in crime rates.

As a result, individuals may be discriminated against by employers or be denied needed and deserved insurance coverage.

Besides, if an insurance agent knows the results of a particular customer, then salesmen will try to avoid offering insurance service to one who has some kind of genetic disorder.

In a word, genetic testing may lead to a genetic discrimination in employment and insurance industry (Genetic testing, 2009). Moreover, even if people know their results of genetic testing, usually they are able to do very little nothings. It is because genetic testing cannot predict how severely one person will be affected by the disordered genes. What is can do is only detecting whether there are any genetic problems.

The adverse effects of global warming cannot outweigh the costs of setting up VHTR. Furthermore, the accidents due to high temperatures can be prevented with sufficient safety measures in place.

Fears of the use of plutonium to be made into nuclear weapons can also be eased as the nuclear waste in VHTR is not reprocessed; consequently, plutonium will not be separated out.

People expect the new and upcoming Generation IV nuclear power plants to be efficient and at the same time expecting engineers and researchers to make it safer and cheaper.

However, the US Department of Energy, just like France, has vowed to ensure the safe disposal of nuclear waste byan accidentting problem components of nuclear fuel into less harmful components and buried it deep into the ground (Nuclear Power and the Environment, n.d). The strict regulation of nuclear reactors by the government and together with the current technology is enough to ensure the safe disposal of nuclear waste.

This amount of carbon dioxide definitely expedites the process of global warming. Comparing the amount of gases produced by fossil fuels and by nuclear power plant, the latter will definitely be the wise choice for energy purpose because it produces zero carbon dioxide and zero poisonous gases.

Opponents of nuclear energy might argue that the radioactive waste which will be produced by nuclear reactors is susceptible to accidents due to human intervention. However, researchers could only suggest better solutions for nuclear plants to produce less radioactive waste but not to the extent of eliminating radioactive waste till today.

Among all these six generation IV nuclear reactor plants, I think the very-high-temperature reactor is the most promising one. We can use this kind of reactors to solve our energy problems. Security has always been the most concerned problem which is also biggest trouble in using nuclear power. For the last few years, very few new nuclear power plants have been built. We are worried about not only the shortage of technology but also the danger of terrorists. Nuclear power could be easily used as a weapon because we do not need to consider controlling the bomb, but if we use nuclear power as energy, then we should make it safe for us to operate it. The big danger hidden in nuclear power plant also makes it a target for those who want to destroy it. From \"Baidu\" dictionary, we know that the power released in the Chernobyl Accident was about 400 times as big as the atom bomb which the US threw in Hiroshima.

However, the concept of this right is a problematic way to define as it is very easy to get confused between legal rights on one hand and natural or moral rights on the other. One may claim it is his right to stay in a country that is safe whereas the other may claim that it is their right not to want the practice of surveillance technology. In such situations, it is impossible for both parties to have their rights. One will have to give up the right to absolute privacy to reap the benefits of the rights to feel safe and secure. Besides having absolute privacy is just an ideal. The practice of surveillance technology is necessary for the benefit of majority as it adopted to improve our quality of life. It will be denying more people rights if surveillance is not practiced. For now, the public seems to find that trade-off acceptable. Furthermore scientists around the world have intensified efforts to perfect the art of surveillance, hoping to catch villains before they strike.

The supercritical water reactor is working at much higher temperature(500\u00baC) and pressure than the generation III reactor(Butler, 2004). It is a dangerous operating temperature in the concept of today. In fact, due to the higher temperature and pressure, the reactor can, however, be safer. At first, the whole concept of the supercritical water reactor is based on the light water reactor which has already used for years. The technique is already mature. The supercritical water is also used in different areas for a long time, so that the supercritical water reactor can be a practical innovation and it is very safe. Secondly, as I mentioned above, the steam has the same density and can be mixed with the liquid, so that the whole moderator have the nearly same density everywhere. It will be much easier to control the pure liquid compared to the liquid mixed with the bubbles. Actually, these voids in the liquid are chaotic and can be very dangerous because that the liquid and the steam have totally different properties. Lastly, the special supercritical water property also makes other procedures can be easily controlled such as cooling part (Magnus, 2006). The supercritical water reactor can be safer compared to the light water reactor. There are still a lot of people worrying about the nuclear waste of the supercritical water reactor (U.S. environmental Protection Angency, 2004). Some of the reactors need to depend on the reprocessing nuclear waste which will separate the plutonium which can be used to make nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, the supercritical water reactor will not depend on the reprocessing nuclear waste, thus it will not separate the plutonium (Butler, 2004). Besides, the supercritical water reactor is can also be developed with a fast neutron spectrum due to the neutron will be only partly moderated in the supercritical water. Being a fast neutron reactor will split the long lived actinides, destroying the most long lived nuclear waste through nuclear transmutation, which will greatly reduce the nuclear waste it produces and increase the efficiency of the reactor (GIF, 2007).

Thus, with a healthy body and mind, elderly are able to continue to contribute to the society and which in return benefit the nation.

Their major events to create public awareness are the Senior Citizens' Week and Active Ageing Festive. In conjunction with the annual event, C3A created a Senior Citizens award, to honour role models and active senior citizens in the community (MCYS, 2006). These initiatives will hence foster family bonding and community spirit, thus a positive environment for everyone to age healthily. Judging by the policies made for the elder, we will notice that the government has invested a large sum of money in them. On the other hand, instead of trying to change what we cannot change like personal health and family upbringings, there should be alternative ways to solve this problem. Education system can be an area worth investing. Children should be taught the importance of filial piety and healthy lifestyle. After all, these children will eventually be part of the elderly population.

However, I would like to make use of an analogy. To say that the use of psychology during the design process would have prevented the accident would be as good as saying that if you studied hard and memorised everything, you would be able to prevent mistakes during the exam. However, we all know that this cannot be true. By studying more, it only reduces the chance of making mistakes during exam but definitely not prevent it. Similarly, the use of psychology might reduce the chance of engineers making mistakes in their design. However, it does not mean that they will not make mistakes as they are still factors like human error which cannot be eliminated through the use of psychology. In the article Psychology and design processes, the author mentioned that all human beings make mistakes, including engineers. \"Design engineers may make mistakes, too, namely in their designs\" (Wilpert, 2007). Therefore, whether or not there is the use of psychology during the design process, it is inevitable that engineers make mistakes.

Coal, oil, and other energy resources are less and less. People start to fix their attention on nuclear energy. In fact, nuclear energy now has been one of the main energy sources to generate electricity in many countries. For instance, the United States now obtains about 20 percent of its electricity from 104 nuclear reactors. The concept of new generation of nuclear reactorsgeneration IV, include these following six systems: gas-cooled fast reactors, lead- cooled fast reactors, molten salt reactors, sodium-cooled fast reactors, supercritical-water-cooled reactors, and very-high-temperature reactors.

Such cases happen due to the health insurer is bent on making money, with no care on whether the person is in ill health(Townsend, 1997). There are policies such as in Britain, which insurance companies should adhere to, where any genetic screening is not a prerequisite in the application and obtaining insurance. Even if it is to be declared, there will not be a change in premium charges as compared to those who declared who has a family history but has not gone for genetic tests. Thereby, it can help ensure that the affected person is able to be under insurance coverage, providing some security especially financial security including for the family members.": 2689, "Scientists and engineers have created safety mechanisms which cause the reactors to cool themselves in the case of terrorist invasion(Butler,2004).This will mean that the efforts terrorists try to cause a deliberate accident will be futile. Moreover, protective double fences are built around the perimeter of the nuclear reactors to prevent the terrorists from entering the premise. Heightened security measures have been taken to ensure that the defence is not breached as well. However, with the introduction of dual use technology, the supercritical-water-cooled reactors can be used as a possibility of military use of civilian nuclear power technology to make nuclear bombs. Dual use technology refers to the making of nuclear bombs and the harnessing of energy from nuclear power. After an intentional meltdown caused by the terrorists, the nuclear core will explode and radiation will be spread throughout the country. As a result, people around the vicinity will suffer from cancer caused by the radiation( BMJ,2005 ). In addition, nuclear waste can be sabotaged and used as radiological weapon if left unprotected. Examples of this case include an incident in Russia in 1999, where workers tried to sell five grams of radioactive material on the market.

On the one hand, some tracking are conducted without people's awareness and permission. For instance, in an Oklahoma Wal-Mart store, RFID tags were hidden in Procter & Gamble Lipfinity lipstick on shelves without declaration. When customers interacted with the lipsticks, they were not aware that they were being observed by the Procter & Gamble executives (Albrecht and McIntyre 2004). Likewise, many companies use RFID tagged product to track consumers' behaviors and collect information without their knowledge and consent, which seriously invades consumers' privacy. On the other hand, although in some cases people are informed, they are still under the risk of losing privacy. It is because within a certain distance, anyone who has the reading device is able to read RFID tags. Thus, besides the real tracking conductors, criminals can also take advantage of RFID to achieve their criminal intent. A security expert Bruce Schneier said that \"When RFID chips are embedded in your ID cards, your clothes, your possessions, you are effectively broadcasting who you are to anyone within range. The level of surveillance possible, not only by the government but by corporations and criminals as well, will be unprecedented. There simply will be no place to hide\" (Sieberg D 2006). In short, since the abuse of RFID to track people leads to the invasion of human privacy. Its use should be banned.": 1325, "First of all, public are against the proposal of building nuclear power plant to supply electrical energy as they are very concerned with safety of the plant. Questions that come to their mind will be. \"What is going to happen to us if the nuclear plant exploded?\", \"Do they contain the deadly radioactive particles?\". The Chernobyl disaster is one of the nuclear power plant accidents that remind people about how dangerous nuclear reaction can be. But we have to look at other things like passenger aircrafts. Accidents happened every now and then, and through these accidents, people learnt and things were improved to prevent the same accidents from happening once again. For example, the windows of the planes used to have square shape in the past but engineer have changed all of them to round shape to improve the safety of airplanes. Because of accidents and people found out the solutions to improve safety. Similarly, new designs nuclear power reactors are there to reduce off-site radioactivity to the minimum if there is accident. The latest nuclear power plant accidents happened in 1999, which is more than 10 years ago. In 10 years, technology is advancing rapidly. Therefore, I believe that nuclear power plant is very much safer than it was in the past.": 1004, "Genetic testing is a scientific method that is used to determine a person's chance of developing an inherited disease. Every person carries copies of genes that were passed down from their parents. There is a high chance for a genetic disease carrier to pass down defected genes to the next generation. The defected genes may or may not develop into a disease. A defected genes carrier can only determine whether he or she have a genetic disease by running a genetic test. Since genetic disease runs in the family, a genetic disease carrier's family members and relatives will have high chance of developing the same inherited disease. There is a highewouldance of curing a genetic disease if it is detected early. Hence, a carrier of a known genetic risk should warn their family members and relatives about the genetic risk.": 2693, "Lastly, many opponents still doubt the performance of nuclear reactors. Until now, the nuclear energy is indeed only taking up at most 8% of the total consumption energy. Nevertheless, this kind of worry is still needless. As we all know, the reactor is small in size while large in energy output. For example, the energy generated by one kilogram of uranium is equal to the energy generated by 2400 tons of coal. Besides, a study done last year by a group of scientists and economists looked at the potential for the power generated by nuclear energy believed that the production of nuclear energy will triple by 2050. Therefore, nuclear energy can take the lead in supplying more energy and decreasing the emission of greenhouse gases generated by the burning of fossil fuels.": 2694, "Moreover, the individual should tell relative about the result of the genetic testing as it will bring the prevention on the family tree. \"Prevention better than cure\" is the slogan always proposed by the doctors. If we are able to know the genetic risk disease, we can seek the help from doctor in order to prevent the heritable diseases (Takala & Gylling, 2001). Breast cancer is the second killer in the world. This cancer can develop with the risk of 85% when the person with the mutation of the genes (Wahrman, 2009). We can reduce the risk of getting this disease with the prevention we done in the earlier time. We can reduce the chance by practicing healthy lifestyle and others. Although some diseases like Huntington's disease and Down's syndrome are unpreventable (Browne). However, we can know them earlier by the revealing of the result from the individual. We can also get ready for these diseases and will not depress about them easily. Thus, in order to apply earlier prevention for the family, the individual should reveal the result.": 2695, "Uranium is the main source of fuel for the VHTR's main system of operation. A once-through uranium fuel cycle allows the reactor to produce high temperature at the outlet core. But unlike VHTR, MSR uses another kind of fuel cycle called thorium, which is much more abundant in nature than uranium (David.S 2007). The first advantage of using a thorium fuel cycle is the ability to burn up most of the actinides which produce radioactivity. Radioactivity is unwanted as it can remain active for hundreds of years if it is not properly contained. (David.s 2007) The second advantage is an enhanced nuclear weapons proliferation resistance. Due to the nature of a thorium based fuel cycle, essential elements for nuclear weapons like enriched uranium cannot be chemically separated from thorium. Unlike thorium, enriched uranium used in VHTR can potentially produce a bomb. Moreover uranium is limited in supply and not as abundant as thorium. The need for expensive fuel-enrichment facilities is unnecessary when thorium is being used as the main fuel cycle too. Both MSR and VHTR are state-of-the-art nuclear reactors. Automation throughout the reactors and passive safety features are just some of the technologies implemented to make the Generation IV reactors safer. MSR's high temperature, low pressure cooling technologies will ensure a safe operation. With the combination of thorium being used as the main fuel cycle, MSR is a safe reactor with an abundant source of fuel. In terms of safety and fuel technologies used, MSR stands in a better position than VHTR.": 2696, "Anyway, all the efforts made by the investigator and engineers are to make the nuclear power plants much safer and the resultant measures can be more widely used to meet the great demand of energy today. Applying psychology provides us with a new option to effectively improve nuclear industry's safety and reliability. Maybe some engineers still oppose the use of psychology, it is worthwhile to include psychology in an engineering design process. I'm confident that with the help of psychology, the usage of nuclear power will have a brighter future.": 2697, "Knowledge is power, but how true the saying is when applied to the context of genetic testing is debatable. Genetic testing is the process of direct examination of a person's DNA molecule. Even though it does not guarantee a 100 percent accuracy (Breast Cancer Organization), it is still used in fields like forensic investigations whereby a person's identity could be determined through the test. It is also utilized in medical diagnosis to reveal any genetic disorders (Human Genome Project) by basing one's genes against a healthy standard of gene pool to spot for any forms of mutations.

While the investigation report showed that the direct cause was a series of wrong operations, the result actually didn't have much relation with the nuclear reactor itself. Currently, the materials applied in VHTR are more advanced and steady compared to those used in previous reactors. For example, the Carbon-Fibre reinforced Carbon can bear the highest temperature which VHTR could generate.

RFID tags are introduced to be sewn into children's attires or set in their wristband to track their positions and activities (Gautam, 2006). The importance of this surveillance technology is that it can make sure of the children's safety so that the parents can work at ease. Although most of the children today have mobile phones, it is also possible that their mobile phones are lost or they are having difficulties to pick up their phones such as kidnapping. If the children are being kidnapped, with the surveillance technology of RFID, the parents can track their locations.

Doubling global nuclear power output (at the expense of coal) would reduce greenhouse emissions by about 5%.\" However, the generation IV reactor that China is going to build will cost China 3 billion Yuan. That is almost 450 million Dollars. How much greenhouse effect can we reduce if we use theses money in other ways?

As the terminology implies, genetically inherited diseases are caused by gene or chromosomes abnormality received from antecedents and passed on to following generations. The possibilities of other family members and blood relatives carrying similar gene mutation are relatively higher when a family history of the particular genetic disorder is detected. The likelihood of the family members and relatives to definitively develop similar genetic disease is hard to estimate due to the influences of different inheritance conditions such as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive (Joaquina, 2009). Moreover, a healthy person not showing any corresponding symptoms of the genetic disease might be the carrier of gene mutation, which might bring about equivalent harmfulness to successive offspring. Hence, alerting these potential disease carriers is essential such that similar genetic testing can be done, either to rule out any possibilities of carrying that particular DNA mutation or to detect the chances of developing the genetic disorder and apply treatments or preventative measures as early as possible.

ITER produces neutron as its waste which could be burned up rapidly (Gerstner, 2009). While the class IV have ctors, produces nuclear waste that contains plutonium and uranium, they incurred a high reprocessing cost and till have 4% of the original nuclear waste left over. Almost all of the nuclear waste that could not be reprocessed are being buried in landfill sites that could take million of years to decompose and also contaminate the land rendering it useless for other purposes. This cost of reprocessing nuclear waste makes up the bulk of the maintenance cost incurred. The ITER could do without the need to reprocess its nuclear waste and therefore could bring the cost down of producing electricity. Another more significant advantage is the performance of the ITER, being able to produce ten times the power as compared to previous versions.

Therefore, during the design process, these plant operators are supposed to be 'designed' as well.

For example, the Bhopal incident occurs due to lack of maintenance work for the plant and the workers neglected the importance of the safety in plant operations. The main cause of accident is due to a worker's mistake of adding water to MIC causing a runaway reaction. Thus, implementing psychology in the design does not help, regardless how well the plant is constructed or having many safety devices installed, as long as the operators neglect the importance of working safely, possibility of accidents occurring is definite. Psychology can be use in areas to promote safety within workers or reinforce the importance of it. Another factor that often leads to accidents is the approach the company or supervisors take on. In the case of Bhopal incident, the plant manger should have immediately rectified the problem like failure of safety device systems. It was later discovered that the storage tank alarm system has not been working for four years and flare system is down for five months (E.Ingrid, 2004) Therefore, if a superintendent of a company shows no concern about safety, it is very likely that workers will take on the similar stand in long run.

Firstly, it will contribute to ensuring the security of society, like \"airport security, airline security and cruise ship security\" (Greene, 2004). It is because RFID is able to efficiently detect terrorists and criminals who hide drugs in their bodies, all objects made by mental, all explosive devices and so on. In this way, public's benefits are protected as much as possible. Besides, in school, RFID can assist officers in checking people who enter and leave school so that they are capable of taking students' attendance and ensuring no unauthorized people come in simultaneously. Hence, RFID makes great contribution to our society. The second advantage of RFID is that it may save operation costs and gain more profits for companies. For example, analysts from Sanford C. Bernstein (Radio Frequency Identification Technology, n.d.) say that the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, saves as much as 8.35 billion dollars per year by applying RFID in its physical counts of inventory. It is because RFID helps to reduce Wal-Mart's operation period overwhelmingly. It takes only five minutes to finish the job which human beings need more than one day to do.

Therefore, they should have the final say as to whether to share it with others and should not be obligated to do so. However, the reticence of one's genetic test result would mean that family members are unaware of the possible danger to their health. Furthermore, it may be too late to be treated should the disease be discovered at a later stage. Thus, the possibility of preventing harm to others should never be jeopardised over one's privacy. A research conducted by the United States' National Institute of Health, has shown that 98% of the respondents share their test results with their family members and 82.2% of them did that to inform them of their medical risk (Stoffel, Ford, Mercado, Punglia, Kohlmann, Conrad, Blanco, Shannon, Powell, Gruber, Terdiman, Chung, Syngal, 2008). This research result is a testimony that majority of those who went for genetic testing acknowledge that by sharing their genetic result with their family members, something can be done to reduce the risk of contracting a disease.": 2822, "As the mankind has entered the 21 century, the need for fuel has become increasingly pressing, which has exceeded the amount of fuel required in the past century by most 50 percent. To solve the complex function of the world's need for more fuel, the solution lies in, as suggested by scientists and engineers worldwide, the generation IV nuclear reactors, which are capable of generating the power needed at a far more efficient rate compared to the contemporary power plants. There are altogether six designs for the generation IV reactors while this essay will focus on one of them named very-high-temperature reactor or VHTR in short and expound on the reasons why it is worth all the researches and money put into it. Generation IV reactors are designed to achieve certain goals, some of which involve generating clean and efficient energy, replacing fossil fuel and increasing resource utilization. The VHTR is specially designed to achieve these goals because it can withstand core temperature as high as 1000 degrees, even the highest among all the generation IV reactors. Having established some common understanding of the VHTR, there are basically three reasons why the VHTR should receive continuous funding and research. First and the most concerned reason of all is that the VHTR guarantees a high degree of safety. Being graphite-moderated and helium-cooled, it doesn't melt easily due to the extremely high melting point of graphite nor does it allow any corrosion of the chamber as helium is a very inert gas which is resistant to reactions that lead to corrosive substances. This property should well fend off the critics using the meltdown accidents that happened at Three Mile Island and Ukraine, as the possibility of such accidents happening to a reactor able to function properly at 1000 degrees is insignificant. Secondly, the VHTR produces energy in a very efficient manner. The VHTR allows for more than 50% of more electricity to be produced from the same amount of fuel intake compared to the conventional reactors. It burns up to 65% of uranium compared to only 5% for conventional reactors. As the non-renewable resources are running out, the VHTR provides an excellent alternative solution to energy generation. Thirdly, the VHTR produces a by-product, hydrogen gas, which is considered as another environmental-friendly source of energy. At high temperature (700-900), H2 is split from water and can be further utilized as fuel for transportation and factories. This reduces burning of fossil fuels, like oil, which generates toxic gases. This property, which can never be reached by the current reactors, serves to preserve the environment by replacing the contaminating fossil fuels using hydrogen gas.": 2823, "Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a type of surveillance technology which has beenpricey for a while now. It works by storing and retrieving data using RFID tags. An RFID tag is a small object which can be attached to or integrated into a product or even a person in order to track them. Although RFID has been claimed to be a useful technology such as in the identification and tracking of criminals, the use of RFID has aroused considerable controversy especially in the area of privacy concerns. Shop outlets, employers and even potential crime-doers can use RFID to prey on their desired targets, hence intruding their privacy. Therefore, surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track people.": 2824, "In conclusion, using RFID to track people not only raises the possibilities of privacy invasion, but also causes health problems.

They argue thbringsr family interest to outweigh one's autonomy is unethical because there may be cases where relatives use one's genetic disorder information to their own advantages, rendering said individual to material loss and mishap social status. For example, a woman can easily claim custody of her children from her formal husband who has Huntington's disease, by asserting he will not have the ability to take care of their children in near future. While it is true that the extreme circumstances mentioned do exist in the society, one must agree that relatives have their reserved rights too, to know about the presence of genetic risk within the family because no one has exclusive rights over his or her genes as they are shared among the family. Spouses too have the rights to know when it comes to making a family just as he or she has equal rights over the children. Indeed, powerful protection has always been given to autonomy, privacy and confidentiality. However, these ethics can be breached when the action has an essential purpose, such as safeguarding others from harm, which unquestionably outweighs those said principles (Andrews, 1994). The absolute priority that they possess should be balanced by awareness of averting medical harm to fellow humans (Wang, 2001).

However, the funding for the research and development for the generation IV reactors is a must as there is an increasing need for energy these days. Furthermore, the issue of global warming also arises and nuclear power would help reduce the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. In addition to that, generation IV nuclear reactors also reduce the waste produced after the generation of the energy. However, opponents may argue that the funding for such reactors may not be useful as they are expensive to construct and the resources used in the funding of the nuclear reactors could be used to further enhance renewable resources currently available.

Their design errors eventually would result in the malfunction of the products, thus cause accidents. Some people accuse that the design engineers of ICE didn't handle the safety design of the train in a careful way. They claim that the engineers were being unprofessional (Eschede, n.d.), because the engineers were concerning more about the interior facilities of the train. According to them, the facilities of ICE trains are second to none. Passengers could enjoy the radio, the newspaper as well as refreshment, including wonderful meals provided from the luxurious dinning car. The design engineers were said to put so much effort into these trivial factors rather than the safety concern. On the other hand, some people defend the engineers. They believe that the engineers should not take the responsibilities and be blamed for the accident. Germany adopted high speed trains and made some changes to them. Soon, ICE were travelling across the whole Germany and were favored by passengers. It is not wrong if the engineers decided to make the train more comfortable and attractive. In fact, over the years ICE expanded throughout Germany, the safety record was perfect. (NASA, 2007) What went wrong when the train accident happened would rather be the construction and the maintenance of the track and the bridge. The maintenance of the track was poorly done, as well as the maintenance of the bridge. They are unprotected by any form of crash barrier. (Eschede, n.d.) If only the work had been done well, countless lives would have been saved.": 2837, "For quite some time now, there has been concern among the pubic over the safe operation of nuclear reactors. This has caused us to oppose new nuclear plant projects. Our dependence on fossil fuels necessarily needs to reduce because of its depletion and possible exhaustion in the near future and also due to the harmful effects on the environment by using them. This makes shifting to alternative sources of fuel inevitable. Newer ideas and technological improvements are possible if the necessary funding is directed towards the research of nuclear power and technologies like them. Since, nuclear power does not affect the environment as drastically as fossil fuels, if its waste is well managed, and provides much higher ration of power to the amount of fuel used, it is the most feasible fuel source available to us. Of the various nuclear power plant technologies, the Very-High-Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is the safest. Implementing this reactor for power production is an achievable goal to set for a sooner transformation to nuclear power. Since the VHTR uses helium as a coolant, it can go to temperatures of up to 10000C as compared the 3000C of the earlier reactors as the earlier reactors use high pressured water as their coolant. Another fascinating fact is that the VHTR's waste goes back to its repository and that it can produce hydrogen from water due to its high working temperature. The above mentioned facts distinguish the VHTR from the Generation III reactors and define reactors like the VHTR and the VHTR itself as a \"model of the Generation IV reactors\" (Clair, 2005). Even after these many safety features, as mentioned above, it is hard for lay men to get over the dreadful accidents that took place in the Three Mile Island in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986. Moreover, the possibility of being able to make nuclear warheads and other weaponry from the active plutonium created in the power plants coupled with the trouble of nuclear waste disposal has maintained the our dilemma.

Governments are well aware of this and have been looking at alternative sources of energy such as solar, wind and particularly, nuclear energy. However, nuclear power plants pose a danger to the surrounding as a target of terrorists and in the event of a nuclear accident.

Countries around the globe are all working for a better quality of life, driving up the demand for energy. There are various ways generating electricity. However, if a mixture of energy production options is continued, it will impact the environment adversely and cause climate change in the long term. Therefore we need to produce energy which is clean, safe, abundant and cost-effective. Nuclear power plants are providing 16% of the electricity in the world, the largest share provided by non- greenhouse-gas-emitting source (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems, 2002). It has significantly decreased the environmental impact of energy generation. Nuclear energy can generate hydrogen which is important for petroleum refinement and can be used as an oil alternative in transportation. Many countries of the world, both industrialized and developing, believe that nuclear energy can be used to meet their demand because of its long-term sustainability and absence of environmental impacts. The concept of Generation IV Nuclear Energy System (NES) is able to meet this demand and its implementation is inevitable. In 2001, founding members of the GIF selected six best designs as reactor prototypes for the future (Butler, 2004). The GFR (or Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor) system is one of them. The GFR is primarily developed to produce electricity and is able to support hydrogen production from water. There are different models and the reference reactor is a 600-MWth/288-MWe, helium-cooled system operating with an outlet temperature of 850\u00b0C using a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems, 2002). With ongoing Research & Development (R&D) for its related technology, GFR is predicted to be delivered by 2025. Though questions have been raised on its pending features of development, GFR should be chosen as the research prototype due to its performance, safety and economics features. There has been doubt on the safety of the GFR system. \"The fundamental safety objective is to protect people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation\" (Fundamental Safety Principles, 2006). Another aspect of safety is the Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection (PR and PP). It is also one of the objectives of a Generation IV NES to \"increase the assurance that they are a very unattractive and the least desirable route for diversion or theft of weapons-usable materials, and provide increased physical protection against acts of terrorism\" (A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems, 2002). To address this, the GFR system has involved measures to enhance PR & PE and has adopted an actinide management to ensure nuclear waste utilization and availability of fuel in the long term. Some people argue that the reprocessing of waste is unsafe. However, there has not been solid proof of accidents. Furthermore, new forms of reprocessing will be improved. Technologically, research on the core design, materials, and fuels is still ongoing. With the effort of scientists and researchers, GFR will be safely deployable if the technical hurdles are overcome. Supporters of other reactors believe that they have better performance. Research has shown that the GFR system ranks the top for its sustainability (Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor, 2005). Like the VHTR system, GFR uses helium as coolant which has a high outlet temperature of 850\u00b0C, making it able to split hydrogen from water. This is ideal for countries largely dependent on oil import because hydrogen is an important oil alternative used in fuel cells. Reprocessing also enhances the performance as it could cut the final amount of waste up to 96% (Butler, 2004). The elements with long half-life are extracted and reused. Only a small volume of waste is left behind. Another debatable issue is the cost of building the GFR system. Each of the six prototypes costs about US$1 billion (Butler, 2004). However in the long term, the cost is justified by the economics-of-scale. It is also a research emphasis to achieve low system cost (Khalil, n.d). For the gas- cooled reactors, this might be done by considering other coolants such as the S-CO2, replacing the cladding materials and so on.": 2844, "Some people have the impression from the two major incidents which happened in Chernobyl, Ukraine and Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania that nuclear reactors are dangerous and are against the idea of having nuclear reactors. The two incidents happened due to high temperature, which leads to the partial meltdown. This would not happen in the new reactors as they have better cooling systems that will allow the plants to cool down faster when they reached too high a temperature (Butler, 2004).": 2845, "Actually, whether individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results of such testing is a heated controversy in society today. While the genetic testing can assist people in predicting and ruling out some genetic disorders and problems which are hard to be find in daily life, it will still bring about some difficult problems to human beings to some extent. Hence, the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing.": 1103, "Firstly, an individual will face genetic discrimination if the individual does not have the final say in revealing a positive result of genetic disorder test. Genetic discrimination occurs when an external party gains access to an individual's health recois honest in declaring one's health condition. For instance, an insurance company will refuse to provide any insurance coge for an individual who may have had been tested positive of a genetic disorder or has a high probability of acquiring a genetic disorder, since the insurance company finds it a loupset make a payout to an 'already or potentially-sick' individual. Furthermore, employers will be judgmental in hiring or firing a 'sick' employee. In America, a new federal law referred to as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in 2008, to prevent discrimination from insurance companies and employers (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2009). Genetic discrimination will not take place if the individual had the final say in revealing the result of such testing, as the individual had withheld the information and life would go on as per normal until the disease presents its signs and symptoms. When the individual is discovered for having a genetic disorder and not declaring the status beforehand, the individual will bear all the consequences, which includes genetic discrimination since the individual had the choice to weigh on the pros and cons of the matter before the individual made a decision on keeping the condition to himself. Therefore, the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the result of such testing.": 2846, "The elderlyng the argument on the fact that public spending othe nation ande limited, I am people todaydare able to that other areas of the countas enjoying the ent should not be neglecit is important to reflect back on theire tendency for public spendIn shortncreasingly especially to elditSenior citizensother areas of the country'stime to baskment have beenof bringing up their children succesd of limitepublic spending on the aged really be limited?": 2847, "* Crompton, M.

Together with GPS, itwere also able to track their location and detect if they are in danger. This can also be used for other patients that requires special attention like heart and lung disease especially when it involves children and older generation. This is useful as the caretaker may not be able to attend these patients 24 hours a day. Thus, RFID help to ease their work but increase the efficiency simultaneously.": 2849, "The past few decades have seen the improvement in technology by leaps and bounds, and one key area in which we have benefitted from is the use of surveillance technology. It is a tool which is not only used to monitor a person or a group's behavior, but it also has the ability to track the locations of people and identify them. Some may express their concern on the use of surveillance technology regarding privacy and security issues and should therefore be banned. However it would be too extreme to impose such a ban. As by doing so, we are throwing the baby out of the water bath. The use of this technology should not be totally banned but more regulations should be imposed and more should be invested in enhancing the security of this technology. This is because surveillance technology will help in crime prevention, improve medical healthcare and also identify a person via biometrics.": 2850, "Medical history of an individual is confidential, and prior into revealing the results to anyone; one should seek the permission the individual and respect his privacy. Although one might argue for the fact that the results might affect his immediate family and the carrier has the responsibility of informing them in order for them to take preemptive measures. Those who took this stand overlook the very fact that genetic testing results only shows the present of the risk, it does not means that the linked disease will surely took place. The immediate family might undergoes unnecessary stress only to discover that for that disorder might not had occurred at all. Once the results are revealed to the immediate family or relatives, there is no doubt the risk of straining the relationship between all the parties involved. The individual might risk being discriminated by his own family and thus the weight of revealing the results or not should lie solely on the individual.": 2851, "Security is one of the primary factors that need to be addressed when monetary support is involved in the advancement of nuclear plants. Unlike the rest of generation IV reactor concepts, SCWR is capable of running the operation without relying on the process of reusing plutonium waste. (Butler, 2004) This could reduce the misuse of nuclear waste which can threaten the world peace as seen in the case of recent North Korea nuclear saga. Under the concept of SCWR, Butler (2004) also states that SCWR have simple safety features that do not depend on well-trained operators and complex backup systems. Furthermore, they are able to solve the heat emission by cooling themselves down if accidents do happen. Opponents of nuclear energy might argue that the radioactive waste which will be produced by the nuclear reactors is susceptible to accidents due to human intervention. However, researchers could only suggest better solutions for the nuclear plants to produce less radioactive waste but not to the extent of eliminating radioactive waste till today. In addition, engineers and researchers are not the only ones who are responsible for the security of the nuclear reactors. Military protection in nuclear plants is another factor that should be considered in the security of the nuclear plants. With strong ground and air defence within the nuclear reactors, the plants would be well-protected and could deter any forms of terrorist threats.": 2852, "The main concern for this technology is with regards to privacy. RFID can be deciphered from afar and they contain more information than barcodes (Free, 2007). Consumers are at the greatest disadvantage when it comes to RFID technology because hidden placement of tags by companies allows information to be retrieved from consumers. These tags which are embedded in consumer products could theoretically keep tabs on a person worldwide provided there are readers in certain locations around the globe. Personal information may be jeopardized by these tags, leaking information like medical history. These devices threaten to deprive mankind of its mysteries, offering a world where people are only told what the government and large corporations approve of.

However, sodium-cooled fast reactors are rather safe because they can react under relatively low temperature of 550 degrees in contrast with the above 700 degrees of other reactors; it also reacts under low pressure. The low temperature and pressure lower the demands of the equipment and the conditions of the reaction; as a result, the reactor becomes safer. Besides, in order to make the reaction safer, in Japan, the engineers have found out the methods to prevent the chemical reactions of sodium itself and the leak of sodium by using double-wall piping method, high reliable equipment with double-wall tube and sensitive leak detector. Thereby, sodium-cooled fast reactors are very safe and also safer than the other reactors in the fourth generation.": 1946, "Almqvist, E.W., Bloch,M., Brinkman, R., Craufurd, D., & Hayden, M.R.

When there was a surge of power, they tried to put back control rods, hoped that power level could be lowered. In fact, it did not happen as expecte the power increased dramatically and explosion occurred. When psychology is incorporated in design engineer's thoughts, this accident could be prevented. Psychology could lead the design engineer to be aware of others either in physical or mental behaviour (Wagner, n.d.).

(Christiana, J., Cirella, N., Lee, B., Sun, J., and Werner- Allen, G., March 2007) Furthermore, in New York, RFID is also being used in schools. According to information released by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics in late November, the crime rate such as school fights and percentage of students bringing weapons to school had indeed fallen since 1990s. Hence, we can say that the surveillance technology in tracking people or products should be used.": 2860, "There are several applications of survecan also be usedgies in medical field.

Given a price tag of more than US$ 1billion dollars in building a nuclear plant (Benjamin, 2008), some will argue that it is more economic to use fossil fuel or other forms of energy. It is true that building a nuclear plant is expensive but with more research and development in it, the cost will be lowered in the near future with better design. Although there are other promising renewable energy sources available, they are not fully reliable. Energy such as wind and solar are unpredictable, they cannot fully replace big base-load plants such as coal and other fossil fuel. While fossil fuel is expensive and suffers from price volatility, cost of nuclear power is relatively stable and low at around 2 cents (US$) per kilowatt-hour, comparable to those at gas-fired plants, as nuclear plants buy their uranium fuel at an agreed price three years in advance (Whitman, 2007).": 1114, "Knowledge is power, but how true the saying is when applied to the context of genetic testing is debatable. Genetic testing is the process of direct examination of ale. Even though it does not guarantee a 100 percent accuracy (Breast Cancer Organization), it is still used in fields like forensic investigations whereby a person's identity could be determined through the test. It is also utilized in medical diagnosis to reveal any genetic disorders (Human Genome Project) by basing one's genes against a healthy standard of gene pool to spot for any forms of mutations. However, the choice of revealing the result to only the patient or to third parties is an issue that is arguable. Ultimately though, I believe that the patient should have the final say as to whether the results should be made known.": 2862, "Secondly, acquisition of genetic information of carrier by his/her relatives can help reduce the possibility of getting the disease.

By using fuel cell, hydrogen gas can be converted to electricity, replacing the uses of fuel or gasoline. Statistics show that VHTR are able to yield 50% more electricity from the equivalent amount of fuel compared to conventional plants. However, to function at such high temperature, helium gas, instead of water must be used as its coolant.

This could be treated via injection of recombinant factor VIII concentrate into the veins within an hour when excessive bleeding starts. (Gene Reviews) Hence, this is crucial to save a hemophiliac from over bleeding especially if he or she is unaware of such condition. In other words, knowing the risks of the genetic disorder can allow preventive medical treatment to reduce the risks of danger to the affected individual. Furthermore, a change in lifestyle can also reduce possible effects of genetic disease like homocytinuria which is the genetic disorder of collagen through a therapeutic diet.

According to Alford (1999), some genetic conditions may go unnoticed while others may be devitalising. Some genetic diseases are congenital and others may not be manifest until later in life. Some genetic diseases can be affected by diet and environment. Advancements in genetic science have resulted in new discoveries in diagnosing, treating or preventing diseases (Shaw, 1995). Prevention is always better than cure. In general, if at risk relatives can anticipate the disease, measures may be taken to prevent the diseases. For instance, relatives with genetic obesity may choose to undergo lifestyle changes such as opting for calorie restriction diet and regular exercise. Furthermore, the ability to predict familial diseases such as a certain type of cancer at a young age may allow for possible successful treatment or cure, extension of life expectancy and improvement in quality of life.

Besides that, some older workers cost more than younger workers due to the seniority payment system. As a consequence, older workers are considered both vulnerable for dismissal, or to be targeted by companies wishing to make workforce reductions, and less able to find new jobs should they loose their current work (Bernard Casey, 1998).

However, the public usually forgets the fact that nuclear can actually be a rich source of energy and is able to have a substantial effect on the reduction of cost and environmental pollution. Moreover, with the advancement of technology, nuclear fission and waste disposal of nuclear can be assured of safety (Partha, n.d). Indeed, nuclear energy should be funded for further research and development. With the numerous benefits of nuclear energy, there is no doubt that nuclear energy should be used.": 1762, "Among the six proposeiseneration IV reactors, three othe currentbelonged to fast reactors.

Despite all these factors, general public may not aware of the refined safety measures that these new reactors possessed. First of all, all generation IV nuclear reactors included passive design that relies on law of nature, which simplifies the current nuclear generator design that has redundant valves and control system. Therefore, during any emergency process, the required human intervention was minimized. Moreover, LFR has a comparative safety advantage compared to the other nuclear reactors designs. Calculation were done to show that LFR has a better safety design mainly because lead served as a better coolant that does not react as readily as compared to sodium and air. (Kamil Tuek, 2006) In fact, the numbers of accidents that may lead to severe accidents were declining in recent years. (U. S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION, 1998)Thus, with these years of experience in improving the safety aspects of nuclear energy, the new design is deemed to be safe to provide service to mankind.": 2877, "Another sector using surveillance technology to track people would be the medical field. Maternity wards in hospitals ensure that babies are not swapped accidentally with the help of RFID tags (Fortune magazine, 2004). Patients are also given RFID tags to wear so that should they begin to collapse, aid can be given to them immediately (Kanellos, 2004). RFID tags are also used to monitor patients with Alzheimer's disease according to Kanellos (2004) to prevent them from getting lost. The RFID tags are broken once patients are discharged so the bed can be prepared for new patients so waiting time would be reduced. Consequently, if nurses did not break the tag, disorder might result since the bed is no longer occupied but the housekeeping team is not informed. Surgeries can also proceed smoothly and timely as both staff and patients can be tracked since they are wearing the tags.

For example, if an employer discovers that the chance that an employee is diagnosed with Huntington's disease is high, the employer may not retain the employee. As a result, individuals may be discriminated against by employers or be denied needed and deserved insurance coverage. This is extremely unfair to an individual by discriminating against his genetic predispositions because we cannot control our genes. Hence, the carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to inform his relatives for fear of information being leaked out, which can lead to potential discrimination.": 2880, "Lastly, opponents point out that reprocessing costs a lot of money and there is research demanding expenses too. In fact, despite the fact that reprocessing and research cost too much money, the molten salt reactor is profitable in a long term and it is economical compared to other reactors. Firstly, the molten salt reactor does not need the high-pressure steel vessel which is expensive. There is no requirement for fuel fabrication. All these can compensate for part of the expenses on the reprocessing and research. Secondly, the molten salt reactor is highly effective and efficient.

Current Generation III reactors are only able to produce 5% of useful energy in uranium where there are plenty of radioactive leftovers. The introduction of fourth generation nuclear power plant allows a new way of disposal of nuclear waste.

Metal sodium is also not expensive but not safe enough at the same time. Sodium has a relatively low burning point and has to be stored in kerosene to avoid it from burning which is a hidden security problem. Thus, the sodium-cooled fast reactor is a good choice but still a little inferior to the supercritical-water-cooled reactor. Lead-bismuth and helium are both expensive and hard to acquire, which hinders the popularization of gas- cooled fast reactors, lead-cooled fast reactors and very-high-temperature reactors. Though water is no better than fluoride salts as coolant, the decomposition of fluoride salts at high temperatures is a great threaten to the environment. Fluorine or HCFCs are can pollute the air and cause damage to the ozone layer. Moreover, it does not require clean and fresh water to be the coolant, so sea water or some used water can be recycled as coolant of the nuclear reactor. Because of the above, water is the most suitable material to be the coolant of the generation IV reactors, so supercritical- water-cooled reactor is largely superior to the other five kinds in terms of coolant.": 2885, "The opponentsnce technology can help to increase work efficiency.

It allows for high-thermodynamic efficiency of up to 48% currently (AREVA, 2009) and it is one of the most efficient designs among others. Thus it translates to higher electrical production efficiency meaning that it can produce more electrical energy. The huge amount of heat produced from the nuclear cores can also be used in refineries, for petro chemistry, metallurgy and hydrogen production (U.S. DOE NERAC & GIF, 2002, p. 48). With hydrogen generation made possible, the VHTR can replace future coal fueled hydrogen production plants, taking over the role of supplying other hydrogen intensive industries and may also be able to generate hydrogen as a source of fuel. Therefore the implementation of the VHTR can offer a wide range of solution to the fuel crisis that is currently troubling the public.": 1126, "In conclusion, one who has genetic disorder or disease is obliged to reveal the genetic testing result hehas because by revealing it, there are severalcommon medical procedures are not able to detect.ily and he can find ways to cure the disease, a couple can prepare tonatment for their child, one can havpeople informationnd he can prevent the disease to cause danger for people ethical and psychological issuesconcerning whetheritindividual's": 2914, "Firstly, using surveillance technology for crime prevention is far more important than individual privacy.

According to park officials of Balboa park in San Diego, California, nine months after the installation of surveillance system, the crime rates has been reduced in all aspects and more people visits the park as they feel more secured (Nieto 1997). In Singapore, the Safety and Security Watch Group (SSWG) Scheme was introduced in 2006 so that the business community will be more prepared to fight crime and terrorism threats effectively(Singapore Police Force 2006). One of the common methods to ensure this is by surveillance technology and this has significantly helped Singapore to be one of the country with the lowest crime rates.": 1127, "Throughout the long-standing history of humanity, the energy has played a crucial role in changing civilization to the new level. But the current requirement of continuous energy supplies have grown so rapidly that many countries focus on exploiting current resources, pushing ourselves to the verge of total depleted resources. Therefore, we are concentrating on searching for new energy source which can probably replace current fossil fuels.Although with many advantages like high efficiency, no carbon emission and so on, nuclear energy still meets with very strong public opposition, mainly due to memories of two horrible catastrophes in the past: Three Miles Island and Chernobyl. Otherwise, it is still questioned about other factors like building cost, performance compared to other rivals, for example, wind energy.

With RFID tags, the employers can combine the data together and better study the workplace pattern so as to improve efficiency. Tagging employees can also reduce human errors and measure time. The employees should sacrifice such individual privacy during the office time and cooperate with employers to make greater achievements for the workplace.

Even the opposite opinions exist, it is still necessary to develop the very high temperature reactor.": 2917, "There are some problematic complications that may arise due to the use of RFID to track people. For instance, personally identifiable information (PII) such as license plate number of an individual carrying an RFID enabled card or travel document can be read by a third party without his consent since unauthorized RFID reader can read the RFID number from the card or document (US Department of Homeland Security 2008). However, some may argue that the benefits of surveillance technology actually compensate the concerns about privacy. RFID tag embedded into items or products can help owners to track down their valuable belongings should their items be stolen or missing. RFID also helps to identify disaster victims, and provide effective treatment for patients in emergency situation in a hospital. While these may be true, without the restriction of the use of the technology, abusive use of the information may cost greatly. In other words, RFID may be used to track people, but only limited to a certain degree. For example, it is acceptable to track patients if the patients concerned really need it.": 1128, "However the risk genes carrier may argue that to tell the information to his or her family member is a violation towards his or her autonomy.

With these concerns in mind, the individual may not agree to tell the family members the information they acquired through genetic testing. But by withholding the information, the risk genes carrier is doing harm to not only himself but to his or her family members. Without telling the family members, the individual might be suffering in silence and no support are given by the family members. On the other hand if the risk genes carrier never informs the family members, the family members may suffer the same fate and this in turn will have a domino effect on the family lineage.

Surveillance technology is a new technology to monitor and find out other people's activities and behavior. There are many kinds of surveillance technology and RFID is one of them. RFID is Radio Frequency Identification that uses electromagnetic spectrum to transmit signal so that we can locate the exact position of someone. However, as a new technology arises, there may be some controversies that follow and RFID is no exception. On one side, some people think that surveillance technology should not be used to track other people because it intrudes other people's privacy. On the other hand, some argue that this technology should be used, especially for security reason.

And by using uranium dioxide fuel particles coated with graphite, the reactors will not release radioactive substances even in extreme high temperature. It has zero waste. In addition, VHTR is capable of producing hydrogen gas by breaking the molecular bond of H2O.

Genetic disorder is considered as one of the severe medicinal consequences due to either those environmental factors or genetic factors by preceding generations. According to National Cancer Institute (n.d.) in the United States, genetic testing is a DNA analysis done to disclose the increased risk of development of a certain disease or disorder caused by genetic mutation. Although genetic testing has remarkably improved our life, it still gives rise to many controversial issues, especially in ethical concerns.

In this essay, I will be using the \"very-high- temperature reactor\" (VHTR) due to several deciding factors. Firstly, the concept of VHTR is the most practical among the 6 reactor concepts. Similar concept has been tested out in Oarai, Japan and the test run was successful as it reached its operating goal of 950 Degree Celsius. As the reactor operates at such a high temperature, it can be use to split hydrogen from water thermochemically. Hydrogen can be used as fuel cells to convert the gas into electricity for cars and homes. VHTR can also operate without having to depend on the controversial reprocessing of plutonium waste which will deter terrorism and prevent nuclear weapon proliferation.

This is very crucial as to ensure that the productivity and the efficiency of workers are kept to a maximum. For instance, employees might seem to be surfing the web for business purposes at all time, but what they are actually doing is personal business such as online banking, shopping and chatting. Skiving and loafing of employees cause companies to lose many man hours and resources. If the behaviour of employees at work is monitored, they will work more efficiently and contribute to the company. It has been argued that one's privacy might be invaded due to surveillance technology (Heathfield, n.d., p.2). However, monitoring can take place under suitable circumstances and to an appropriate extent as it is only installed at the working places. It has also been said that surveillance of employees can affect the relationship between employer and employees (Heathfield, n.d., p.2). However, this only applies to those minority spending most of the time online doing personal things and do not meet the company's goals. Using of surveillance technology has no impact for those focusing on work and doing the right thing (Heathfield, n.d., p.2). Furthermore, security issue is very essential for factories manufacturing coins and jewelleries. Surveillance cameras can trace the movement of the workers. Suspicious behaviour by the employees can be reviewed by their employers through the electronic records. This can alleviate the theft rate in the factories. As a result, surveillance technology can facilitate the employers to monitor their workers with an extent of not breaching their privacy. Moreover, surveillance technology is vital in ensuring the safety of public. Through video and satellite surveillance, polices can track the movement of dangerous criminals and terrorists. Besides that, tracking of missing or kidnapped children (Stump, 2008, para.1) is made possible too. With the help of CCTV cameras, the whole criminal processes can be recorded. By that time, polices are able to trace the culprits' physical appearance and vehicle's number. Then, the time taken to solve the criminal cases is tremendously reduced, compared with the crime not being recorded. The video recorded becomes a concrete proof to subject the culprits for sanction. Eventually, public security is guaranteed. On the other hand, for those having disease like Alzheimer's disease, surveillance technology facilitate in finding them out if they get lost in somewhere else. Similarly, those running away from home, possibly caused by family factors or mental problems, can be tracked via CCTV cameras in the shortest period. This prevents them from doing things that are unfavourable or irrational.

Experiment has shown that an RFID identification card can be skimmed and cloned by a hacker. Furthermore, using the cloned card, the hacker was able to pass into the restricted area through the secure and locked entrance (Jones 2008).

However, they can choose not to be told of the test result in the first place or go for a genetic testing to confirm whether they have the genetic disorder.

One would be concerned that this information will be intercepted; duplicated and abused by others or that the device could be used to track an individual's movements and location. Proof hackers can clone these RFID chips and hence cause the risk of identity theft to increase.

Every pallet, carton and big-ticket item being shipped to the military was affixed with a RFID tag (Bogonikolos, 1999). With complete product information on a tag, enemies can conveniently extract information off a tag. The information can then be used to identify the military's strengths and weaknesses and can be used to endanger the country, its soldiers and civilians should the information fall into the wrong hands.

Current Generation III reactors are only able to produce 5% ofeven whenful energy in uranium where there are plenty of radioactive leftovers. The introduction of fourth generation nuclegenerators. The new reactors are built to be more efficient in absorbing heat through using better coolantshere fuels originating from reprocessed nuclear waste would use to power Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR). VHTR not only solves the nuclear waste problem and current wastes are of very valuable source of energy to power VHTR as it can burn plutonium, neptunium and other materials that Generation II and III reactors left behind (Smith, 2009).

It is a fact that nuclear power plant does produce waste known as spent fuel. This spent fuel has different radiation level and requires special handling. However, the US Department of Energy, just like France, has vowed to ensure the safe disposal of nuclear waste by transmuting problem components of nuclear fuel into less harmful components and buried it deep into the ground (Nuclear Power and the Environment, n.d). The strict regulation of nuclear reactors by the government and together with the current technology is enough to ensure the safe disposal of nuclear waste. Furthermore, in the aspect of zero pollution by nuclear energy, opponents of nuclear energy will have no choice but to agree with this fact. If we were to compare the amount of greenhouse gases and poisonous gases emitted by fossil fuels in contrast to nuclear energy when operating the reactors, there is an astonishing statistics showing the huge amount of harmful gases emitted by fossil fuel. 2249 pounds of carbon dioxide and thirteen pounds of sulphur dioxide is being produced in the production of 1MWh of electricity (Nuclear Power and the Environment, n.d). This amount of carbon dioxide definitely expedites the process of global warming. Comparing the amount of gases produced by fossil fuels and by nuclear power plant, the latter will definitely be the wise choice for energy purpose because it produces zero carbon dioxide and zero poisonous gases.

Nuclear plant operates at extremely high temperatures and it relies heavily on coolants to reduce temperature. Any malfunctioning of the cooling agent will have devastating consequences when the nuclear plant melts. However, VHTR addresses this problem by using helium as its coolant, which can reach extremely low temperatures (Butler, 2004). As such, the temperature of the core is maintained at a low temperature to deter melting. In addition, Helium itself is an inert gas, which will not react with the radioactive waste or substances in reactor. This is much safer compared to Sodium-Cooled reactor, since Sodium is explosive in contact with air or water. Therefore, VHTR is operating safer compared to other reactors.": 481, "Nowadays, people are living longer than in the past and the growth of the world's population is increasing expectedly to around 10 billion by the year 2050. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for energy usage throughout the world. According to the article of Nuclear Power/Nuclear Dawn (The Economist, 2007), the global electricity consumption is expected to double in the next few decades [1]. Furthermore, due to the depletion of unrenewable energy such as coal and fossil fuel, the scientists in many countries start to seek for a new source of energy, which is nuclear energy. Although the potential for the uses of nuclear power energy is great, there are a number of opponents with anti-nuclear sentiment, preventing the construction of nuclear plants in the past few decades in many countries. Such issues include the safe operations of nuclear reaction As a result, the generation IV nuclear energy system was introduced, which was an improved design from their predecessors, Generation IV reactors are offering significant advances such as clean, safe and cost effective. Therefore, The very-high temperature reactor (VHTR) was introduced to meet global energy demands.": 1148, "Since the introduction of nuclear-powered generators, public opposition was one of the reasons why only limited nuclear reactors have been built in the pasthe public is against the idea of constructing nuclear reactors because they are concerned about the safe operation of nuclear reactors.

However, I believe that previews of the nuclear reactors should not influence the decision to fund the research and development of the generation IV reactors as people will be more careful not to let the same incidents happen again with the advancement in technology. Therefore, I feel that generation IV reactors such as the Supercritical-water-cooled reactors (SCWR) should be funded for their research and development.": 2951, "Opponents also claim that constructing nuclear power reactor is a huge capital-intensive project, which requires intensiOpponents'tment of money and research.

In the case of SCWR, due to the presence of high pressure and possible corrosion, the expenditure on research and maintenance will be high. However, the other reactors also face challenges that require substantial technological and financial supports. If the ratio of gy output and all inputs is considered, the rate of return of SCWR is faster than the othe level, not mentioning the low price of the electricity when the design is successful. Then the traditional oil or cohardly possibleerators will be disadvantaged because of the rarity of these non-renewable resources. Moreover, comparing with the other five ideas which use inert gas, liquid compound or metal as coolants, water is much easily accessed and present in relative abundance. Thusdefectsufacturing process of coolant is simpler for SCWR, and also cheaper. Also, due to the presence of light water reactors, there is already extensive worldthose risksrience in constructing and operating this sort of reactor. This saves a lot of experiments and provides information for scientists. The experience minimizes the chances of any experimental failure and in turn saves the research funds.

So SCWR is economically favorable.": 2952, "An important reason why an individual should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of genetic testing is because people have the right to protect their privacy. The decision of informing family members the results should be a personal choice. Because the results of genetic testing not only affect the person who takes the test but also relates to his family members, sometimes people may encounter dilemmas. Individuals may make different decisions depending on their situations. For example, after undergoing genetic testing, people may find out that their siblings also have the same genetic disorder as them. However, informing them may result in huge changes in their life decisions. Thus, whether to tell them the results or not is a cautious decision that should be made by individuals (Norrgard 2008). Some may suggest that it is an ethical responsibility for people who are found to have genetic disorders to inform the results to their family members.

Some may argue that the information is the individual's privacy, thus it is up to him who to reveal it to. However, it is the individual's responsibility to tell his family members regarding this. This is because might be harmful for him to keep this as a secret as he might be emotionally disturbed by it. According to a survey done on women regarding factor V Leiden (FVL), 77% women were emotionally disturbed by genetic testing . When people are emotionally disturbed, they might not be able to think rationally thus this may be harmful to the individual's health as it may result in depression and unbalanced diet. Some individuals do not want to reveal it to his family as he do not want his family to be worried.

In the case of Challenger accident, the management committee made an inaccessible schedules and 'modify the technical and procedural standard' for the engineers (Craig L. Howe). Without sufficient time given, how could those managers expect the high qualitative component parts of the space shuttle to be produced? Even though some of them would probably argue that they were not familiar with engineering process, they could not refuse to take the blame. In this respect, the use of psychology during design process requires them to make a schedule based on practicability after consultations with engineers, which will help to guarantee each individual process of the system to operate well.": 1160, "Robotic surgical system will be the step medical authorities have to take for the better of mankind. It should be evident that arguments regarding safety, cost, as well as better performance are addressed. Instead of shunning away, we should learn to be receptive and reach for greater height in both the medical field as well as the robotics field. \"If you are looking at the future, it's hard to envision a hospital not offering robotics,\" said Robert Glenning, chief financial officer at the Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey.
