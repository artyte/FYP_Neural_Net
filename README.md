Grammar Correction with Deep Learning

Sub Project:
- basic ANN ([reference tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/))
- LSTM binary classifier on English sentences with wrong grammar <- currently attempting

Status:
- Scraped data off wiki pages into csv
- Corrupted randomly selected english sentences (3k+ sentences out of 6k+ corrupted)
- added data splitter on wiki_history_write.csv to create 80/10/10 data split
- all code callable through classes
- created list of sequence of indices
- created LSTM neural net model
